{text:"I was just talking about this with my girlfriend last night. We are both Christians and we strongly feel that gays should be treated just like any other individual. Every person sins, and no sin is greater in the eyes of God, so why should gays be persecuted so much? It really bothers me and is one of the main reasons I no longer attend my church but still practice my faith.", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"I must say that the implication that Christians who do not support gay marriage aren\'t acting like Christians is quite turned about. I do agree that those who hate or otherwise discriminate against someone based on their sexuality are very wrong- but those who do not support gay marriage in the name of their faith have that right and are allowed to express it.", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"I\'m curious as to why people are down-voting this?You make excellent views, and while I am not a christian..this part always confused me. Why does religion ostracize and reprimand gay people. Why does being gay conflict with how one follows a religion? ", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"We\'ll see, my contention with the church\'s stance on the issue is: 1. Jesus never forced ANYONE to do ANYTHING, it was all choice.  2. How are we any better than the racist oppressors in the past of our nation if we oppress gays this way?       3. Sin is sin, all heterosexuals sin just like gays do in the eyes of a Christian.... So does that mean we as a Christian coalition should also begin lobbying the government to jail people for adultery since we apparently want to ban gay marriage for it being a sinful matrimony? that is clearly a double standard ", bewertung:"-1"}
{text:"This probably doesn\'t relate to the OP\'s use of the word, but I don\'t think gay marriage requires my approval.", bewertung:"-1"}
{text:"I wish more Christians felt this way. One of my relatives says that she doesn\'t disagree with giving gays the right to unions (with the same rights as marriages), as long as it\'s not called \"marriage,\" which is between a man and a woman. But marriage is just a word. I don\'t even know where to start.", bewertung:"-1"}
{text:"\"After all, isn\'t the \"golden rule\" in Christianity to treat others how you would like to be treated?\"To be honest, no, it\'s not.  But it is ~your~ golden rule, and my personal golden rule.  But it\'s by no means the golden rule for Christianity.", bewertung:"-1"}

{text:"So, if Christianity was against gay marriage, you would be against it.Because you are a Christian. Saying it likes this makes your compassion seem a bit flawed.Definitely not trying to bash you here, actually I want to say that YOU are a good person. You should credit your own good thinking and your own compassion as I am sure that you would have come to this conclusion with or without Christianity.", bewertung:"1"}
{text:"Weren\'t Lot\'s people punished for being gay? Why would that apply back then and not today?", bewertung:"-1"}
{text:"My opinion: (and I\'m ready for the downvotes). The word marriage means a union between a man and a woman. Yes, I know certain rights come along with calling something a marriage, and I don\'t believe those rights should be restricted to man-woman. I do think that we shouldn\'t be changing the word marriage to mean stuff that it doesn\'t mean. The ideal solution, and I don\'t think I\'ve found anyone who doesn\'t like this solution, is to take the term marriage out of the legal definition. That way, people aren\'t getting \"married,\" they\'re getting \"civil unioned\" or whatever you want to call it. Then they can choose to call it a marriage if they please. The government doesn\'t need to recognize it by the word \"marriage,\" they just need to recognize the union.", bewertung:"-1"}
{text:"I approve of gay marriage because I want other people to be happy during the one life that I believe we get.  And, as a fellow citizen of the US, I want them to be able to enjoy the same civil rights that I do.  I do not approve of gay marriage because that\'s how I decided to interpreted a belief system based on a bronze age text.", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"I think the majority a christian families are like yours. Mine is and so are just about all of my friends. Too bad the loud mouth fubdies give everyone a bad name", bewertung:"1"}
{text:"I approve of gay marriage, because recognition of it is consistent with the 14th Amendment, which I am required to recognize regardless of religious affiliation or lack thereof.It\'s also shitty to discriminate against people based on \"moral\" objections about their association.", bewertung:"1"}
{text:"Exactly man, being a Christian is all about loving people. God speaks (mostly) a language of love so seriously why do we have unequal rights for people pursuing the same thing God supports? Good lucky guys, I pray to God that some day people won\'t judge others by sexuality!", bewertung:"1"}
