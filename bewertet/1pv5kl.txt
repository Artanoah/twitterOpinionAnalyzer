But we don\'t go around judging non-members for drinking coffee. We think nothing of it. Why? Because no one else believes it is a sin.The same principle should be applied to *all* sins, including homosexual relations (again, I believe it\'s a sin, but I mean no offense to those who believe it\'s just as natural and beautiful as a relationship between a man and a woman).My view? I believe drinking coffee is a sin, but I am making no effort whatsoever to prevent other people from freely partaking of it. I\'m not even judging them for it. I feel the same way about homosexual relations (and I say \"relations because I believe that homosexuality is not a sin, but *acting* on it is). I believe it is wrong, but I have no right to judge the people who don\'t believe it\'s wrong, nor do I have any right to try and remove their ability to choose to live that lifestyle.TL;DR: As a Mormon I don\'t judge coffee drinkers, so why should I judge homosexuals?EDIT: I do believe in \"missionary work\", and sharing my beliefs, however once shared, the decision is left to the listener.

{text:"Literally my first post ever, but this is one that I\'m passionate about. Took that much to get me out of my shell, I guess. I am a devout follower of Christ, and the hypocrisy the church commits near constantly offends me more than I can really express here, so for that I deeply apologize. I did my senior capstone project on an analysis of the evolution of the church from ancient times to the first century church to modern day, including lots of fascinating things such as exegesis, breaking of denomination, etc. (sarcasm). I got a bible degree, with psych and education minors. Specifically referencing the portion discussing homosexuality in the church I researched brought me to a unique conclusion, and it is very unpopular among my peers:  Homosexuality has been a sin due exclusively to the inability to have sexual relations within a legally recognized union. Now that it is legal, that must change. The only sin found in homosexuality is the one of sexual intercourse outside of marriage. The introduction of a legal marriage option removes the only sin, so there must be other reasons why the church rejects homosexuality.The reason so many people feel homosexuality is so unacceptable is because it is an act of sexual deviance. If the median sexual action is between a man and a woman, homosexual sex deviates from that. Not that this is necessarily wrong, but it is objectively true. That being said, many people group this particular form of sexual deviance with all others, such as rape, incest, pedophilia, etc. This sheds an unfortunate, and inaccurate light on the view the general population of the church has towards homosexuality. As mentioned before, the idea of a man having sex with a man is gross to most straight men, so that discomfort combined with the idea of being similar (again, misconception) to rape or molestation, leads people to reject it, then to follow up by citing bible verses out of context to support it. This presents a larger problem than whether gay marriage should be allowed. Another larger issue is how the church deals with homosexuality. If, contrary to my findings, a church decides homosexuality IS a sin, it becomes their responsibility to react to that sin with love and inclusion, not with exclusion and loftiness. Did Jesus, the one we claim to model our belief structure after, ever avoid someone in his ministry because of their sins? No. He ate with them, taught them, loved them. He is called friend to sinners for a reason. Why should the church behave differently? So while I personally do not feel homosexuality is a sin, if it were, it is NO different than any other member of the church, and not including homosexuals is just as much of a sin as them hypocritically claiming homosexuality is.TLDR  From a biblical perspective, whether homosexuality is a sin or not isn\'t clear, but the need to love homosexuals the same as any other perceived sinner is. The church is wrong for excluding homosexuals. ", bewertung:"1"}
{text:"Morally, I am not for gay marriage. It definitely goes against my Christian beliefs. I can not say, and reconcile, gay marriage within the purview of my beliefs. However, gay unions should definitely be allowed, with all the same benefits and restrictions as heterosexual marriage. Jesus was loving of all walks of life, the prostitutes, the tax collectors, the dregs of society. As an American, we hold all men are created equal. Withholding that privilege from a group of people based on sexuality seems wrong on a lawful level. TL;DR I don\'t support gay marriage on a moral level, but on a lawful level I am for it. And as a Christian, I find it better to love on people rather then judge and condemn. EDIT: I don\'t think homosexuals are the dregs of society, I was saying that God loves even the worst, so why should Christians not love homosexuals.

{text:"I\'m not necessarily opposed to gay marriage being made legal. If a country wants to legalize it because people want it, it should, because it\'s a democracy.My issue with gay marriage is more cultural. I don\'t like how it\'s trying to lay claim to an exclusively heterosexual cultural ritual as some kind of human right being denied them. It is not. It\'s a cultural rite of passage that arose in and is exclusive to a specific segment of society, just like the bar mitvah, baptism, or confirmation. Marriage sprung up as a means of curbing illegitimacy in the heterosexual world, transitioning a girl into womanhood and motherhood, and transitioning a man into manhood and fatherhood. Why do you think the father walks the bride down the aisle? He is officially letting go of his \"little girl\" and giving her away to be the \"woman\" to the new man in his life, who now \"owns\" her. She becomes that \"woman\" and gets \"owned\" by her husband by losing her virginity on the night of her honeymoon and giving him lots of babies. I know, I know, it\'s tacky at how old-fashioned and sexist this all is, but this is how and why marriage developed. What does this cultural rite of passage have to do with being gay, when so much of it is based on heterosexuality, right down to the symbolic gesture of one man (father) giving a young woman away to another man (husband)? Nothing. Why is it being seen as some kind of \"human right\"? It shouldn\'t. It is what it is-- a heterosexual ritual, just as Communion is a Catholic ritual or Sweet 16 a one for little girls or whatever-- and segments of society have the right to preserve their rituals without people attacking them for being bigoted or narrow-minded because they don\'t see the *logic* of extending it to people other than for whom it was intended.So this is my issue with gay marriage in a nutshell. Gay people have every right to be seen as part of a legal union. But trying to get everyone to accept it on a cultural level as  \"marriage?\" Doesn\'t make any sense.", bewertung:"-1"}
{text:"*Sorry for the long post...*Just as a heads-up, I\'m a Christian father of two, in my mid-twenties. Should give some context. I\'ve been doing a lot of soul searching lately, as this issue seems to be a defining one in our times, and I\'m still trying to come up with a concrete answer. But here are my thoughts.First, as a devoted Christian, I take the Bible seriously. WHen it explicitly calls something *sin*, I treat it as such, despite my personal hang-ups and equivocations. I know, many argue that this could be a \"cultural\" issue, that homosexuality was deemed as unclean in the time of the writing of the Bible, that this fits into instructions like \"do not wear jewelry.\" However, homosexuality was just as accepted in those days, if not more... Just look at Greek and Roman lifestyles (which is who these letters in the Bible were being written to...) So I can\'t imagine this is actually something that is just culturally irrelevant now. It\'s sin... My belief anyway.Also, as a parent, I mostly get up in arms about my kids, growing up in a world where something I see as wrong is widely accepted and encouraged. I fear for having to explain to what sex is to my girls, because homosexuality was brought up at school. I don\'t want their first inkling of sexuality to be addressed in kindergarten when their teachers talk about how having two daddies or two mamas is just as healthy as a mama and a daddy... I don\'t want them to grow up having to answer questions for themselves that I never had to ask, at a younger age than I ever thought about. I just fear for my kids\' safety and little perfect world that I try so hard to set up.THAT SAID...When I look at the person of Jesus, I can\'t help but see someone who unconditionally loves those around him. He extended grace. He did not judge. He realized people hurt, and have pain, and he said that was okay. If you look at his life, you see the only people that Jesus ever really criticized were the religious, self-important moralizers. Seem familiar...? Us Christians traditionally suck at actually doing what Jesus did and said. On behalf of all of us, I\'m sorry.  I think if Jesus was walking the earth right now, he\'d be ashamed by a lot of people who call themselves Christians. Possibly myself included.I want to protect my kids. That\'s a good thing. But doing it at the expense of loving my fellow man? Nope. Not okay. Jesus calls us believers to sacrifice ourselves, daily. Give up our comfort, our safety, our *personal preferences*... Set them aside, and just love people. With Jesus\' help, I\'m learning to do that, day by day.TL;DR: morally against gay marriage, not politically at all. Afraid for my kids\' future. Not a good enough excuse though, when I look at the life of Jesus. Learning to love and accept others.**EDIT: Figured I\'d answer some FAQs**&gt;What will you do if your children end up living a homosexual lifestyle? Have you thought about that?I definitely have. A lot. I believe in unconditional love. At leastI aspire to it. I\'ll love my kids, regardless of their actions, attitudes, or beliefs... Even if I disagree. I respect them, their right to make informed life choices... Even if I disagree. The most important thing is not being right, but demonstrating love and grace. No doubt, it\'d be hard and difficult, but I am 100% commuted to not driving my kids away, even if I know it\'s sin. Reality check: we all sin. All Christian\'s everywhere have sinned, and continue to do so on a daily basis. Not that it OK\'s it, (Romans 5-8) but it demonstrates our daily need for Christ.&gt;What about all the \"other\" sins that are forbidden in Scripture? Seems like Christians pick and choose what they want to believe...There\'s just some general confusion on this. In the New Testament, Jesus said he \"came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it.\" He didn\'t negate the laws written in the Old Testament, but rather to bring them to completion. As a basic overview, in the Old Testament (OT), there were *many* laws laid out. Most all of them were ceremonial in nature (how to perform sacrifices, rites, rituals, many cultural things to set the Jewish people apart from other cultures in their day), but other laws were considered moral laws (think the Ten Commandments) and there were far fewer of these. What Jesus meant by saying he came not to abolish the law but to fulfill it, he is saying that the ceremonial law is done, as believing in Christ is now the way to be in relationship with God, Christ\'s blood being the sacrifice that gets us there. However, the moral laws are even tighter and are set as a higher standard. For instance:*Matthew 5:27-28 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.* We\'re now called to a higher standard based on our intentions and motivations, not just outward behavior... Hard stuff. So, to respond, it\'s not that we arbitrarily pick and choose what is sin and what isn\'t. Rather some is applicable and some isn\'t... And a lot of it is up for debate. But I think I can affirm that most honest Christians have come to a general consensus of what constitutes a ceremonial law versus something that is moral in nature. Homosexuality would be something regarded very much as a break in the moral law. Again, just my opinion and understanding.&gt;What about shellfish? What about mixed fabrics? Etc, etcI\'ll just answer with this: Mark 7:14-23 \"Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.” After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. “Are you so dull?” he asked. “Don’t you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them? For it doesn’t go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body.” (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)He went on: “What comes out of a person is what defiles them. For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.  All these evils come from inside and defile a person.”&gt;But it\'s still sin! Don\'t condone the sinful act. It\'s truly loving to tell them what they are doing is wrong!I firmly believe that can only effectively be related in the form of relationship. No homosexual EVER has been reached by the Westboro Baptist Church. They push people out, keeping them at arms length, judging and hating. Christ would meet them where they are, then in love and kindness, confront their sin. The person in question could reject that, surely... But isn\'t Christ and his love infinitely more compelling than judgment and hate?", bewertung:"1"}

It\'s not so much the fact that it\'s homosexuality it\'s the fact that they are refusing God\'s will. Not saying it\'s worse than other sins as I believe all sins are equal but I believe those that we continue to practice and refuse to give up separate us from God and do not allow us to be a Christian.

{text:"To me, proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage are arguing on two different tracks, which is why the debate rarely goes anywhere.I think SSM is a bad idea, but to really understand why is going to require some patient consideration.First, for opponents of SSM, fundamental premise is that the lifelong, exclusive union of a man and a woman is a uniquely important relationship that is worthy of special treatment. From this perspective, the argument is that this particular kind of union is worth singling out for a sort of positive discrimination - a bit like charitable donations are singled out for favourable tax treatment.Why single out the lifelong, exclusive male-female union? Well for a few reasons. First, the male-female aspect of the relationship is biologically unique and significant in a profoundly existential way. It is how our species remains in existence. If you think that human existence is important, then it follows that the biological union that facilitates human existence is also important. You can recognise this regardless of your sexual orientation, and many people do.Secondly, the lifelong, exclusive union is uniquely important in this context because it creates a strong framework within which children can be nurtured into responsible, pro-social adulthood (and so the cycle continues).Eseentially what I have described is an ideal. For proponents of \"traditional\" marriage like me, the point of male-female marriage laws as we know them is to propel heterosexual relations towards this ideal for the benefit of children and of society, and hopefully the couple too.You\'ll notice I put the beneift of the couple last in that list. That\'s not an accident. The idea of a lifelong, exclusive union assumes there will be a degree of self-sacrifice in a successful marriage, whereby the couple put the interests of their children and of society ahead of their own individual interests (for example, their interest in pursuing other sexual relationships). That\'s why the traditional formulations of marriage vows don\'t focus on how the couple FEEL about each other on the day - they focus on the hardy reality of a lifelong union: richer or poorer, sickness and health, for better or worse.That last one is a real humdinger. To promise to be faithful to someone til death, even if it\'s for WORSE.Why go to such lengths? Well if marriage is actually not just about the couple, but about the role they are about to play in the creation of another generation of humans, then the union they are entering into is best served with a healthy side of foresight and responsibility for all that that entails.None of the above denigrates same-sex-attracted people. It merely points out that there is a unique and profound significance to the male-female union (reproduction) and that it is uniquely advantageous to encourage reproduction to take place within a context of lifelong, mutual commitment.This is just the tip of the iceberg, and this iceberg goes DEEP. There are many arguments and counter-arguments and counter-counter arguments, but they rarely see the light of day because it is so hard to talk about this issue without passions becoming inflamed.For example, many people see this argument and jump straight to either \"but gay people have babies too!\" or \"thanks for explaining why infertile people shouldn\'t be allowed to marry.\" The responses to these kinds of legitimate points would each require a post about as long as this one.I also haven\'t delved into counter arguments to the most prominent pro-SSM arguments, because I want to go to sleep.As someone who has wrestled with this issue long and hard, I\'m not really interested in changing anyone\'s opinion. But I would like to see the proponents of SSM acknowledging that it\'s not all about homophobia (even though for some people that\'s all there is to it) and that just MAYBE there are some thoughtful folk out there who oppose SSM for quite reasonable reasons, without condoning any disparagement or denigration of the people most affected by this issue.", bewertung:"0"}

A government choosing who can and cannot marry for me is like saying who can and cannot be baptized, etc.Ideally there should be no legal marriage at all. From a legal point of view, adults living together should be seen as adults living together and nothing more. Legality behind property and custody should be handled by legal contracts to avoid conflict should a relationship end. For me, equal legal recognition of same-sex and polygamous marriage is an inferior alternative, although it is closer to ideal than the situation at hand.", bewertung:"0"}
{text:"\"The Church teaches that respect for homosexual persons cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual behaviour or to legal recognition of homosexual unions. The common good requires that laws recognize, promote and protect marriage as the basis of the family, the primary unit of society. Legal recognition of homosexual unions or placing them on the same level as marriage would mean not only the approval of deviant behaviour, with the consequence of making it a model in present-day society, but would also obscure basic values which belong to the common inheritance of humanity. The Church cannot fail to defend these values, for the good of men and women and for the good of society itself.\"  http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20030731_homosexual-unions_en.html", bewertung:"0"}
