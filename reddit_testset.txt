The idiots who tried to limit love between consenting adults today will be seen by the next generations as indistinguishable from racists, misogynists, and other sorts of bigots.This is why teaching history in school is important...  but then, the people who were pushing this agenda are generally the same ones who have been gutting our public school system.
