{text:"Ah.  This explains why I\'ve tried to register twice now here in GA and gotten jack shit in return.EDIT:  Since this has gathered some attention, more details.  My wife and I moved to Georgia a few months ago.  She took care of the DMV paperwork (including the massive ad velorum you pay up front, holy shit that is a kick in the balls on top of regular moving costs), and registered to vote at the same time.  She registered with no problems.I attempted to do it online back in August.  Nothing back for a month or two.  I attempted by mail.  Still nothing back.No party is specified when you register.  I\'m a mid-30s white male, so I doubt I\'d be flagged as \"POSSIBLE LIBERAL DO NOT SERVE\" by some crooked public servant.  I don\'t think it\'s a case of sinister scheme, more deliberate negligence.  High poverty county, mostly liberal (well, for GA anyway), not given the resources it needs for voter registration.

I didn\'t really think much of the first registration being lost but when the second also didn\'t go through, I started to become concerned.

{text:"I had to search pretty hard to find the decision. Anyone interested can see it [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_KEK8-LWmzhdlJNemFIOWlCQVk/edit). The part that I think is interesting is as follows:&gt; The Petitioners\' request, at its core, is not just that the Respondents be ordered to perform their mandatory election-related duties. Through this petition the Petitioners seek to control how the Respondents\' duties are carried out. The Petitioners consider the process designed and instituted by the Secretary of State to be unsatisfactory. They contend that where some applicants appear to be neither pending nor approved, there should exist some standards regarding the timeliness of the performance of the mandatory registration-processing duties. They further argue that the Secretary of State ought to rework this process to be error free and transparent. But mandamus is not available for compelling the manner of official action. Mandamus lies only the compelling of the legally mandated action itself. Bland Farms, LLC v. Georgia Dept. of Agriculture, 281 Ga. 192, 193, 637 SE2d 37 (2006). The manner of the Respondents\' actions in carrying out their duties, as established by the legislature, cannot be reviewed here, as the manner of their actions is set out by statute. \"Our responsibility, and the only authority this court has, is to interpret the law as it was written by the General Assembly. The wisdom of legislation rests in the General Assembly.\"So, basically, the petitioners tried to get a writ of mandamus to force the Secretary of State to do the things that the Secretary is already mandated to do. But the court found that the petitioners provided no evidence that this process wasn\'t being done. The petitioners then say that *the way that the Secretary is carrying out his duties is insufficient*, because if things don\'t happen fast enough the people that submit applications incorrectly have to do a provisional ballot, which they feel is effectively disenfranchisement. But the court then says that the writ of mandamus is not designed to detail *how* and official does something, just that they do something provided it can be proven that they are, in fact, not carrying out their duties to the best of their abilities. The court then also says that the complaints about the provisional ballot have nothing to do with this case, it\'s a problem of legislature. I recommend reading the whole decision, it summarizes things really well and can help you get past all of the other junk that typically surrounds these sorts of things. Regardless, it basically comes down to the fact that the petitioners did not provide solid evidence that the Secretary of State was not acting to his duty.I\'m sure somebody with more legal expertise is going to come in and give me a lashing, but I love reading a decision and arguing about it, so let\'s just have a good time with it.", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"I can\'t understand why Americans haven\'t had another revolution over the massive bullshit around voting and voter registration.  But then, I\'m spoiled; I\'m Canadian.Until about 20 years ago, before every expected major election, Elections Canada would hire a bunch of people and essentially do a census.  Workers would literally go door-to-door and ask \"Hi, who here is 18 or over and a Canadian citizen?  What are your names?  Great, thanks!\"  Voter registration was, like, 97% or something.Then they set up an electronic National Register of Voters.  They started with their last \"census\" list.  They then update the list by drawing from sources like:* Provincial/territorial DMVs; when you get a licence or renew it or change your address, whatever form you fill out will have a tickybox for \"Send your information to Elections Canada to update the National Register of Voters?\"* Income tax forms.  Similar tickybox.* New Canadian citizens being sworn in.  Similar tickybox.* Provincial/territorial vital statistics offices for deaths (no tickybox, hard to make a tick when you\'re dead).The voter registration rate is lately down to 93% or so, but it\'s still a pretty damn effective system.The fact that the country that likes to boast of being such a great example of a democracy/republic/whatever has a voter registration rate of **71%** is just absolutely completely mind-blowing to the rest of the democratic world.", bewertung:"-1"}
