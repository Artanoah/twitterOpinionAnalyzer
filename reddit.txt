{text:"Assume a late 30s schlub I\'ve never felt more sympathy for new graduates than I do now. My generation just passed on through the adulthood gates without shaking anything up because the late 90s dotcom boom was taking care of us so well. We didn\'t know it, of course. Something\'s always unjust. Textbooks were 70 or 80 dollars. Outrageous!It took a while but I see how bad it is now for kids who were in the same boat I was 15 years ago. I would be pissed off and I\'m pissed off for them. There were implicit promises that I counted on while growing up. If I finished high school I could go to college. If I went to college and got a degree I would get a good job. If I wasn\'t in med school I could pay off my loans within 5 to 7 years. I got my degree. I paid off those loans. And i didn\'t have to pay 150 or 180 dollars for a textbook, or $3k for a single course.What the fuck is going on now? How can we just overlook the fact that this promise is fundamentally broken? How strong is the comfort in our collective pretension that is our \"achievement\"? That somehow it\'s not our fault that the same promise we relied on to become successful isn\'t being fulfilled for the next generation? What happened to making sure that our kids have a better life than we do?Here\'s a simple reality: we are the clueless new money that we used to hate. And rather than fix it we\'re going to blame everything around us but ourselves. We\'re even worse than the Boomers we despise. The downvotes will bear it out. We don\'t want to come to terms with reality because it\'s too unpleasant.Edits based on feedback: I didn\'t mean \"new money\" in the traditional sense of \"we\'re rich and barely did a damned thing to earn it!\" I was trying (poorly) to convey the idea that we reaped the rewards of the system that promised them to us if we worked for it.I also agree that there\'s plenty of blame to go around and it\'s not all, or even a majority of, our fault as \'80s kids. But I do believe we need to embrace the concept that all that is required for this evil to flourish is for us decent folks to do nothing. We can start by voting, for one. The millenials kinda put us to shame on that front, though they probably had stronger motivations than we did. Still we can do better for them and for us. The older generations only have the power because we can\'t be bothered to stand in line once a year.", bewertung:"-1"}

Because if you look around, those people at the top wearing nice suits, in charge of Wall Street and buying legislation are *not* liberal, open minded people. They use the Bible and Christianity to justify their hatred and sexism, they hide behind their money and the church. Fuck these people. These are the people that ran America into the ground. The \"moral majority.\' The Bush leaguers, the southern bible beaters.Their time is over and I couldn\'t be happier that it\'s coming and coming soon. I\'ve been alive a long time and I can say beyond any shadow of a doubt that the most hateful, judgmental, racist, sexist people I\'ve ever met claim to be Christians. And I realize that doesn\'t mean that all christians are hypocritical assholes who feel superior to everyone else but whenever those people are so accepted and celebrated in the Christian community speaks volumes about what those people consider important.", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"The funny thing is that the religious right is the very reason why millennials are so godless.  There\'s so much animosity against the religious right for being generally pretty stupid, which makes Christianity leave a bitter taste in young people\'s mouths.  As someone who came to atheism from a background of religious *culture* but not *practice* -- my parents are Jews but very non-practicing, if lightly believing -- I never got this antipathy that I\'ve seen in others.  I love my religion, because why shouldn\'t I?  I don\'t need to believe in it to be part of it!  But many people have been put in difficult positions by their families\' religion.  Some families are creationist and refuse to accept evolution; some kick children out for being gay.  You can\'t expect a reasonably enlightened young person to put up with that.  The religious right is, by being so rigid about dumb things, sealing its own political doom when young people stay far, far away.", bewertung:"-1"}
