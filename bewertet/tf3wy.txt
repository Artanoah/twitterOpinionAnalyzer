{text:"If the video doesn\'t load, here are the integral quotes:&gt;\"I have to tell you that over the course of several years as I have talked to friends and family and neighbors when I think about members of my own staff who are in incredibly committed monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together, when I think about those soldiers or airmen or marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained, even now that Don’t Ask Don’t Tell is gone, because they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage, at a certain point I’ve just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same sex couples should be able to get married.\"and&gt;“It’s interesting, some of this is also generational. You know when I go to college campuses, sometimes I talk to college Republicans who think that I have terrible policies on the economy, on foreign policy, but are very clear that when it comes to same sex equality or, you know,  believe in equality. They are much more comfortable with it. You know, Malia and Sasha, they have friends whose parents are same-sex couples. There have been times where Michelle and I have been sitting around the dinner table and we’re talking about their friends and their parents and Malia and Sasha, it wouldn’t dawn on them that somehow their friends’ parents would be treated differently. It doesn’t make sense to them and frankly, that’s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective.”", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"I\'m sure that smarter people than me will discuss this with better data, but this may turn out to be a pretty savvy move politically. - The number of winnable voters, who might have voted for Obama but for this pronouncement, must be de minimis. It seems likely that the large majority of people powerfully motivated by opposition to gay marriage are completely lost to Obama.- Liberal Democratic voters just got something to get excited about, and to donate, campaign, and block-walk for.- Gay voters (and donors, and their families) are seeing the beginning of the end for the biggest obstacle to full legal equality. Tremendously motivating.- Obama took a huge step to permanently binding the younger generation of voters to identify with the Democratic party. Support for gay marriage is overwhelming among younger voters. - Can you imagine how charming the coming shitstorm from the right is gonna be? Do you think it\'s going to win a lot of moderates into the GOP fold?- Gay marriage is unpopular with black voters, but Obama is uniquely positioned to get 90%+ of black votes regardless. What are they going to do, vote Romney? And isn\'t it likely that the President\'s stance could lead to a softening of opposition in the black community?- Similarly, Latino voters tend to oppose gay marriage, but they have been kicked in the teeth by Republicans so hard in recent years. Maybe gay marriage is less of an obstacle than zealous anti-immigration laws, \"show your papers\" laws, and the general contempt for Latinos prevalent in much of the activist right. I hope so.I might be being Pollyanaish, but if Obama wins, this will probably be seen as a brilliant risk. If he loses, it might scare Democrats off of supporting gay marriage for another generation.So let\'s make sure he wins, OK?EDIT: For example: http://www.dccc.org/marriage-equality", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"For those on the right calling out Obama on his “evolution” and intimating that he has been, in fact, for gay marriage the whole time, you are absolutely right. Good eye, Cletus. Most fair-minded people are.And for those on the left who have been cursing him for not immediately taking action to impose a liberal-friendly agenda, chill the hell out and give him a little space. Rome wasn’t built in a day and ignorance can’t be outlawed overnight.His decision not to announce his pro-gay marriage view until now was totally political. And unfortunately, totally necessary. Change, regrettably, has to happen slowly in America. Perceptions have to evolve. We have to baby step. People don’t respond well to drastic change, no matter how common sense it might seem. When Clinton enacted DADT, you can believe that he knew it was ridiculous. Think how silly and insulting that policy was in retrospect. You can serve in the armed forces, you can put your life on the line for our country, and okay, you can be gay. But just don’t let us know about it because it’s icky.But at the time, America wasn’t ready for an outright ban of sexual discrimination in the military. And Clinton, seeing the longview, realized that the best that he could do at that point was to get the ball rolling in some way. To ease people into change. And finally last year, when people were ready, they got rid of DADT entirely. This is how change is responsibly effected.And what has happened? Has our military crumbled? Have we heard many reports of soldiers rabidly banging each other against one another’s will? Of course not.Far lefties and far righties will condemn The President for not being true to his convictions; For hiding his true colors for political purposes. And they’re correct. He did. But he has little choice. Being an extremist candidate in a specific, extremist area and running for congress is one thing. A candidate representing the Los Angeles area could spark up a joint and then blow a dude during a televised debate and they’d still elect him.  And a candidate in Arkansas could burn a cross on a black guy’s lawn on MLK Day and they would still elect him and then have someone airbrush a representation of that event and put it on their state license plate.But when you’re running for President, it’s a different deal. How does being completely candid with your opinions and totally up front about your convictions work out at a Presidential campaign level? Ask Ron Paul or Dennis Kucinich. Admire both of them for their candor, whether you believe in their ideals or not, but then look at their numbers. America, as a whole, isn’t having it.Now, I will not be so gracious as to let this also totally apply to Mitt Romney. He’s a moderate despite his efforts to change.  Everyone knows it. That’s his grave misfortune considering the present state of his party.   But this guy has not just “evolved”.  He has blatantly changed positions on virtually every major issue. There’s a big difference between being pragmatic and just being habitually schiesty and pathetically malleable.  Romney’s positions change throughout the day depending on where he’s speaking. Even staunch Republicans recognize that, and though they are less likely to say it out loud now they were screaming it from the rooftops before he was their unavoidable candidate and they realized they were stuck with him.I do not agree with everything Obama has done and said. Not by a long stretch. But I have always been able to see his game plan. And he continues to impress me with the methodical way that he attempts to accomplish his agenda.To me, today’s announcement was as inevitable as it was refreshing.", bewertung:"1"}
