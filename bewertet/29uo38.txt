{text:"Former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard had a very interesting reason for not supporting gay marriage.  She was against marriage as a whole, saw it as an archaic and redundant institution which promoted a religious agenda and was inherently anti-women. She refused to support the expansion of marriage when she had strived since young adulthood to put an end to it as a whole. Can\'t say I am against gay marriage, but that is the only argument I\'ve heard against it that makes near any sense. EDIT: Woah, this is the most up votes I\'ve ever received in my life. Glad I could bring an interesting opinion into the mix. Have really enjoyed reading all your responses. Thanks guys! ", bewertung:"-1"}

{text:"I don\'t think the state should sanction any marriages. If you want to get married by the state it should be called what it is-- a civil union (regardless of straight or gay). Marriage is a religious thing that the government should have no say in. If a church wants to marry any union of two people, I say power to them. My main argument against is that the state shouldn\'t have any say in marriage whatsoever, not anything against gays.EDIT: I keep seeing the argument that marriage is civil and holy matrimony is the religious version. Matrimony is the same word as marriage (it means act of getting married; or being married). My question to them would be: isn\'t that exactly what I\'m saying with different words?", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"The supreme court of Iowa asked exactly the same question in a high-profile civil rights case:http://www.iowacourts.gov/wfData/files/Varnum/07-1499(1).pdfThey got these five replies, which presumably are the best that a large, well-funded legal effort could muster:**Tradition is important, and banning gay marriage maintains tradition.** The court rejected this as circular reasoning, rather than an actual reason, and noted that it applies equally well to, say, interracial marriage.**Children are important, and banning gay marriage promotes an optimal environment for raising them.** Now, this one is not quite as trivial as the previous one, since taking care of children is actually a valid objective. However, the evidence is pretty clear that there\'s not a significant difference in outcomes in child-rearing, and even though some amount of uncertainty always remains, it\'s dangerous to ban things based on vague suspicions. And then, of course, there are plenty of other groups of people who you might want to ban from marrying on this criterion: sex offenders, say, or people who\'d been convicted of violent crimes. And what the hell is up with banning gay *marriage* rather than gay *parenthood?* The court concluded that this argument is obviously not the real reason, but just some after-the-fact bullshit rationalization.**Banning gay marriage will raise birth rates somehow. Babies babies babies.** The court rejected this argument as making not a lick of sense. \"The briefs, the record, our research, and common sense do not suggest such an outcome.\" They quickly move on to the next argument:**Banning gay marriage will promote the stability of straight marriages.** Rejected for being, as far as the court could tell, completely unsupported by any kind of evidence.**Marriage costs the government money, so banning gay marriage is thrifty.** This argument applies equally well to banning marriage among any group of people. New rule: you can\'t get married if you\'re left-handed.The court ruled unanimously that there was no rational reason for banning gay marriage -- in fact, they seemed kind of embarrassed at the poor excuses for arguments listed above -- and Iowa has allowed gay marriage ever since.", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"Is this question about governmental recognition of same-sex marriages or a moral opposition to same-sex marriage?  If it is about governmental recognition of same-sex marriage then I am against it because I don\'t the government should recognize any marriages.  I think marriage should be a personal and/or religious institution and the government should really stay out of that.  If it is about moral opposition to same-sex marriage my belief is nearly 100% religious based and I admit that.  However leaving religion out of it, I believe that the family unit is the corner stone of a stable society and civilization, and I believe that the \"traditional\" family unit of a man a woman and children is the optimal family unit.  However, these are just beliefs absent of hard facts so I can\'t very well in good conscience inflict them upon someone else thus my answer to why the government should not be involved in marriage.

{text:"It should not be understood as gay marriage (ie marriage for gays) but marriage that includes gays (ie the marriage is the same for all and is extended to gays), which is different. Because in the first case, it is something specific to gays and one would be wondering why it should be of any concern of any other people. In the second case, it is a communal good whose definition is changed by the inclusion of an extra group. This extension changes the definition for every one and thus everyone has a right to have a word on the matter.It is not the business of Canadians to decide how Mexicans define themselves, but it would become Canadians\' business if suddenly Mexicans were to claim that they are Canadians.That\'s to first answer the objection that gay marriage doesn\'t do anything to other people\'s marriage. People have to understand what marriage is initially about. Marriage is not about recognizing a couple\'s love or whatever romantic BS that came about in the 20th century.Marriage is initially a way to assign paternity to a man because for the longest time, there was no way to know who the father of a child was. Marriage allowed to assign paternity: the husband is the father, period. Fatherhood has always been - until paternity tests - a strictly social role, unlike motherhood which is both a biological and a social role. Yep, there is an unavoidable biological fact at the origin of marriage...Why is it important to assign paternity? Well, it is only important in SOME societies, ie, those where children are brought up by their parents (which, unless people reject basic science - which happens often in the USA - must be a male and a female ever since sexual reproduction came to be). Some societies function with a communal type of upbringing, or other types, but not western societies. This is actually changing indeed and some people can regret that, just like one can object to polygamy which works perfectly well in many countries around the world.Most people seem to not realise that marriage actually protect women, because, as anyone can see regarding single parents, it is women that are abandoned with the children, rarely the other way around. It is actually why marriage became a religious sacrament in medieval Europe (yes, for the first thousand years of Christianity, marriage was a least bad solution, but certainly not something worth praising): marriage allowed women to not be repudiated anymore by forcing men to keep their wives (the Church fought hard on that, even with kings, cf. Robbert II of France), which used to leave them destitute and with kids (so overall not good for society). There is a biological barrier there: women bear children, men don\'t. Having a child for a man is only a fuck. Not the case for women, so it is not surprising that they end up with the kids most of the time. Flash forward to nowadays. The thing is, marriage has, in practice, lost its use: people don\'t even realize why it\'s there anymore (they\'ll say it\'s to celebrate their love and whatnot), and women get repudiated in practice (single parents are mostly women). Another thing thing that will have a tremendous anthropological change: paternity test. Now paternity has become exactly like maternity: a link founded by biology. This people, you won\'t see the end of it.Now it is not because practice differs from theory that theory should be discarded. One can regret that people are not polite anymore. Should we ditch politeness just because people aren\'t? The existence of a norm, even if it is not followed, still gives an idea of collective values. It was the case with marriage: although no longer the case in practice, it was an institution that was the foundation of the nuclear family.So what has gay marriage got to do with all that? Well gay marriage is the nail in the coffin. By definition, a gay couple is infertile, hence the automatic follow-up to gay marriage: surrogate mothers, artificial insemination without medical cause, etc. So with a marriage that includes gays, now there is not even a pretension - as for infertile heterosexual couples or couples who didn\'t want kids - to have anything to do with recognition of paternity.True, the practice of modern monogamous marriage has been far from what the theory was originally (so much that the theory is different for many people). So in effect, gay marriage is the recognition of the demise of marriage. That is why the argument that gay marriage doesn\'t do anything to other people is wrong: it does. It\'s the official end of what marriage as a norm has been because it has changed the meaning of the norm. So gay marriage destroys the norm of what marriage was (ie the framework of family) - and I have to stress that for people who will have a hard time understanding: gay marriage didn\'t destroy the practice, it\'s been in tatters for a while now.It heralds the new meaning of marriage (love, love, love). But noone needs marriage to love. Since you don\'t need marriage to be a father either any more(thanks paternity test), then marriage has no more meaning and as such, should be an institution that should now be discarded, like jousting, dueling, engagement ceremonies, etc.If marriage is what gay marriage is, then what use does it have? The family has no use of it anymore and indeed many countries in Europe have already seen a steep decline of marriage because it doesn\'t serve any purpose in practice when you have collective systems in place to take care of women and their children. If it is to \"publicly show your love\" etc. then just do your fancy ceremony, no need to involve officials in it.**tl;dr: gay marriage is the unplugging of marriage while some wanted to try to keep it alive.**", bewertung:"0"}

{text:"I was hoping for some interesting arguments, but I really think the responses here have strengthened my opinion that gay couples should be allowed to marry.  It seems the majority of the responses are:1. Procreation argument - a primary objective of marriage is procreation, and gays can\'t procreate.  But no one has that I\'ve seen, provided a sufficient response to the counter-argument that if this were true, sterile couples, or those with no intention of reproducing should not have the same legal marriage rights as those couples with children.  Most people think these heterosexual couples should still be able to legally marry.2. People think marriage is not something the government should be involved in, and that allowing gay marriage just furthers this idea.  But pretty much everyone that is making this argument concedes that this is a more general objection to our current institution.  For the record, I agree that the state should not be involved in the institution of marriage, but while they do (especially while they do), I think marriage equality is a constitutional right.3. Children are more likely to become well-acclimated members of society/have a higher well-being if they are raised by heterosexual couples than if by homosexual couples, aka that a child is best raised by a father and a mother.  As far as I can find, there hasn\'t been a ton of long-running, extensive research on this, but what we do know is that there isn\'t much evidence that a child raised in a heterosexual marriage will be better off (2013 study by Tufts, for example), and some have even concluded the contrary, that children raised by homosexual parents could be more likely to better adapt to society (see 2010 study by academics at UCSF/UCLA in the journal \'Pediatrics\').4. We have defined marriage traditionally as being between a man and a woman, and we shouldn\'t change that, in the spirit of maintaining tradition.  I think most reasonable people would strongly disagree with this idea, when you look at how far we\'ve come in terms of gender and racial equality, and even back to things like slavery. Being able to progress and change things we see as \"wrong\" is a cornerstone of democracy and we should always be trying to improve our society if we have any investment in its success and the success of its people.5. Homosexual unions are contrary to some religious beliefs.  Whether or not it should be (again, I think not), marriage is a legal institution, so religious guidelines are irrelevant in this context.  These religions may also dictate that you shouldn\'t have sex before marriage, but it is not illegal to do so.  If marriage were purely a religious institution, I may be more inclined to oppose the religious marriage of homosexuals.6. Emotional opposition to homosexuality in general.  I get it, some people are extremely uncomfortable with the whole idea of homosexuality, but that again is irrelevant in this context.  They would argue that homosexuals are in some way disabled or have some sort of abnormal condition, which is merely an opinion and, somewhat related to (5), should have no effect on our current, legal institution that we have created.Have I missed any other significant arguments? I\'m genuinely interested in hearing various ideologies, but so far I\'ve not seen anything that\'s even made me question my support for marriage equality for homosexuals.Edit- though it may not seem so, my post wasn\'t to try to push my opinion or change the minds of people with their own ideas, but actually the contrary, I want to understand the arguments people are making so I can use them to further my own understanding to reform my own opinion.", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"As someone who is personally against gay marriage for religious reasons, I do not believe there is any grounds for the united states to ban gay marriage as an institution.As the land that prides itself on freedoms of all sorts for its people, it should give gay couples the freedom to marry. The forefathers of the US created the nation so that no man would have his freedoms deprived of him because of the governments biases towards religion/societal norms/etc..The only time that the US should deprive people of freedom is when they are using that freedom to deprive OTHERS of freedom/safety. At this point in the debate, with the way our society has defined homosexuality as simply \"another option\", being gay vs straight is no different or harmful than being white vs black. So in the same way our country got rid of segregation and lack of rights between races, it too should get rid of any segregation and lack of rights for different sexual orientations.", bewertung:"1"}
