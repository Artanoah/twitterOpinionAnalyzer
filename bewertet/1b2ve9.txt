{text:"Although [this interview](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/21/archbishop-cordileone-gay-marriage-catholic-church/2001085/) is with a Catholic Archbishop, it doesn\'t mention God, the Bible, or other religious stories.His main argument seems to be:&gt;To legalize marriage between two people of the same sex would enshrine in the law the principle that mothers and fathers are interchangeable or irrelevant, and that marriage is essentially an institution about adults, not children; marriage would mean nothing more than giving adults recognition and benefits in their most significant relationship.

{text:"Of course I can present an argument against gay marriage.Here\'s one:1. The sky is blue2. Ivory comes from elephants3. Therefore, gay marriage should be bannedNo good? The conclusion doesn\'t follow from the premises? Well, try this:1. Aliens are watching our planet2. They will destroy the planet if we do something they don\'t like3. They don\'t like gay marriage4. We don\'t want our planet destroyed5. Gay marriage should be bannedThat\'s a perfectly valid argument. Somehow, I don\'t think you actually want an argument against gay marriage. You want a *sound* argument against gay marriage.", bewertung:"0"}
{text:"The only semi-decent ones (that fit the criteria) that I have heard dealt with the effect that it could have on children. Maybe we will discover that for some reason, maybe biological or social, children are better suited in a family with 2 genders. I dont think its a good one, but its about the only one I could see.The argument is about the different roles a male and female would play in development. These roles can be met by any gender. If part of the role requires the use of male/female genitalia then you probably shouldn\'t be doing it....This argument was used in the supreme court today, and I was curious why they would bring it up as a defense for marriage when the state in question allows same sex couples to adopt.", bewertung:"1"}
{text:"It really depends on how you see marriage, I do not recognize marriage as necessary family-wise. I think we should popularize better ways to form families, I sure as hell should not need to marry someone I consider a brother, in order to have them being considered family. In fact whether you love or not someone, should not be a reason to be given a \"special status\".Therefore I see only one reason to keep marriage alive, as an incentive to baby making. In that sense gay marriage is utter BS, at least man to man as neither can carry a baby. Given sperm banks and no lack of sperm around, female to female seems doable. Of course if your will is to increase growth, then simply giving extra benefits to birthing and caring parents should suffice.We should also count that I think we have more than enough people, so creating an incentive to population growth is not a policy I stand for.", bewertung:"1"}
{text:"One of my friends argued that homosexual relationships last on average 2/3 as long as heterosexual ones, and that homosexuality is positively correlated with mental health issues, even in places where it is well accepted, and this means we shouldn\'t support gay marriage. So it is a secular argument... (Not one I agree with though... I need to send him my rebuttal at some point. Also, I think his motivations behind the argument are religious)", bewertung:"-1"}

{text:"As a follower of the Messiah, I have one thing to say...one thing so many forget...so many let themselves become trapped in.1st Corinthians 5:12 states \"For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Donâ€™t you judge those who are within?\" GTThis means that we cannot justly judge those who do not claim to know God. This leaves arguments of gay marriage being unholy and sinful as pointless for Christians to debate. If it is a Christian who wishes to marry the same sex...then, and only then is the right to judge...as they claim to know Yahweh.But since most gays do not claim to know Yahweh (profession of salvation etc), we have NO RIGHT TO JUDGE. All other arguments are mere attempts to force moral beliefs of one upon another, which is a violation of the philosophy of liberty.Though gay marriage is *not* a right. Neither is straight marriage.", bewertung:"0"}
{text:"By compiling the studies from, i think, was 10 countries, involving 15,000 people, there was overwelming evidence that children who lack recognition and acceptance from their father are likely to have major behaviour and development problems. Could be an argument against two mothers.Im on my fone but i will search for the info.Edit: [Here is an article]( http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120612101338.htm). Got the figures wrong. It was from 36 studies across the world involving 10,000 people.", bewertung:"0"}
{text:"There seem to be a lot of posts about this. Here\'s one argument:1. If gay marriage is moral, then gays know they are in love with each other. 2. Gays can\'t know that they are in love with each other3. So gay marriage isn\'t moral.Here\'s another:1. Male homosexual couples have high quantities of infidelity compared to heterosexual couples. 2. If 1, then homosexual marriages are a bad idea. 3. So homosexual marriages are a bad idea.
