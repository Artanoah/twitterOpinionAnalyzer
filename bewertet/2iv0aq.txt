Better also tell them that Jacob had two wives, Abraham slept with his wife\'s maid at his wife\'s suggestion, Judah slept with his daughter-in-law because he thought she was a prostitute (and then tried to have her stoned for her sin when she got found out), King David had multiple wives and concubines and committed adultery, Lot got drunk and was seduced by his own two daughters, and Samson had plenty of sex out with women he wasn\'t married to.", bewertung:"0"}

He was going on about \"you can\'t change the definition of marriage.\" So I asked him if he would be okay with it being called something else, but it has the same benefits. He obviously said no. He clearly doesn\'t give a fuck about definitions, he just doesn\'t like gay people. ", bewertung:"-1"}

But treat people with understanding.      OPTION B: You can catch teh Ghey.   In this case, the more gay men, the less there are chasing women. It\'s just boosting your chances, for fucks sake. You should welcome it - more babe for you!!!       Either way!!       Oh wait - It\'s option B, and YOU are scared of catching Teh Ghey? That\'s it, isn\'t it?

{text:"Exactly! I used to have debates with people about this and after they throw the bible at you, their only argument is, \" Homosexuality is disgusting and perverted. People who are gay are sexual deviants!\"Uhh, ok!? So going on that logic, the majority of sex and marriage should be illegal. Suppose you find sex between two people you don\'t find attractive disgusting; there\'s at least about 75% of the population not allowed to get married. I just think it\'s ironic that homophobes are completely ok with BDSM, urinating and defecating on eachother, etc. But two gay people who love each other... \"Oh Hell No! That\'s unforgivably the most vile act of sex imaginable! And it vaguely refers to homosexuals in the Bible so it should be interpreted into our laws, even though there\'s separation of church and state.\" Congratulations, you\'re an ignorant idiot!", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"I\'m sad that the battle is \"over\" and we squandered the opportunity.Instead of asking the state to sanction a new category of unions, continuing to impose narrow, politically defined rules on personal relationships, the \"same sex\" movement should have been a movement to end state involvement in marriage.Yes, we have many daughter laws and rules that rely on a marriage licence to define a relationships but those secondary rules could easily be re-worked to accommodate a more open system.Instead of beneficiary rules and medical custodianship and so forth being defined by a marriage licence, just have people sign a statement specifying who they want to \"have\" something. A pair of elderly sisters combining households to better make ends meet should be treated the same way as a traditional newlywed (in whatever form of private ceremony and arrangement they like) couple or a same-sex couple or a plural marriage of 3 or 30.Legally speaking, marriage is just a contract. We should not allow the states to mandate any aspect of a personal contract. The state is only there to *enforce* it.Why do we let the political process write the terms of personal relationships?And incidentally, if you let the parties to such a contract pre-determine each aspect (in reality what would happen is most would pick from a list of boilerplate provisions) of that contract, they have greater ownership of the terms of the marriage and it would cut down a lot on court disputes.", bewertung:"1"}
