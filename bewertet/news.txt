{text:"Great news, but of course Governor Parnell says he\'ll appeal the ruling. Uh huh, because that worked *sooo* well for Idaho, also in the Ninth Circuit.Also, fun fact: Alaska was the first state to pass an **outright** constitutional ban on same-sex marriage back in 1998. Hawaii passed an amendment earlier that year that granted the legislature the power to ban same-sex marriage, but it wasn\'t an outright ban in and of itself.EDIT: [The ruling](https://www.scribd.com/doc/242750104/3-14-cv-00089-38).", bewertung:"1"}

How can a same sex marriage ban be unconstitutional in Alaska but not another state like Texas?", bewertung:"0"}
{text:"The governor will appeal to \"protect the constitution\". Maybe a better way to protect the constitution would be to make it fair for everyone and remove targeted discrimination.

They can claim they technically didn\'t vote for same sex marriage, it\'s out of there hands, oh well.  The writing is on the wall, a majority of americans, and a good chunk of their own party, don\'t give two whistling shits about same sex marriage.  However, realistically, I\'m sure they\'ll kick and scream and make more noise than ever and continue to look like shortsighted fools.  Under the belief that somehow continuing down this path will bring a few extra bigots out of the woodwork and into the voting booths.  Unfortunately for them, this sort of behavior turns away just as many, if not more voters. ", bewertung:"1"}
