{text:"I\'ve read the following argument once. I don\'t really agree with it but I think it might fit here. The author\'s main point was that gay marriage is unfair towards other partnerships.The classical marriage between a man and a woman is in a way the \'ideal\' form of relationship, since it \'produces\' children for an economy (I\'m talking about marriage, since some people, including me, still like the idea of a life-long vow to be faithful. More a moral/psychological thing than religious).If we allow gay marriages they will benefit in various ways (mainly taxes and stuff like that) withou them \'providing something to the economy\'.At the same time other life-long parterships (eg siblings who live together and don\'t have any other kind of relationship, or someone who lives with a parent to take her of him/her) don\'t recieve something like tax reliefes or benefits regarding their income or adoption rights (why shouldn\'t a brother and a sister (or sister/sister or brother/brother) be allowed to raise an adopted child together?).Covering all possible kinds of these partnerships is practically impossible and thus, in the opinion of the OP, a marriage between a man and a woman should be the only marriage to be recognized by law.Sorry if it sounds weird sometimes, english is not my native language.", bewertung:"-1"}

What if a trio of consenting adults in a polygamous relationship wanted to all be married to each other? A lot of people, even open minded people who don\'t care at all that they\'re polygamous, would say \'but that\'s not what marriage is, marriage is between two people\'. I think non-religious people who object to gay marriage have a similar outlook: \'but that\'s not what marriage is, marriage is between a man and a woman\'. It\'s more semantics and the legal and social meaning of the word and the institution. IMO. ", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"I\'m not atheist and I do believe in gay marriage, but I\'m going to throw my 2c out there because it might be of related interest.For a long time I didn\'t believe in gay marriage, and it wasn\'t a Christianity thing even though I identify loosely as Christian, and in my younger days was devout. (Most of the homophobic content in the bible is socially driven - eg the prohibition on male-male temple prostitution). I felt that marriage had evolved spontaneously and hetero-centrically in many societies over many millennia, and it wasn\'t our place to mess with that. I had no problem with civil unions but I felt that marriage should be left as it was. It was basically an anthropological argument.So what changed my mind? Firstly becoming aware that there had been various kinds of same-sex marriage through history. Second, that some very different societies with very different influences were starting to be in favour of it at the same time. At that point I reconsidered and reached the conclusion that gay marriage was part of a spontaneous evolution of marriage as a cultural artefact, and not a socially-engineered imposition. Now I\'m pro gay marriage and have even been a celebrant for one.", bewertung:"1"}
{text:"Devil\'s advocate, as I am every time this comes up:Marriage from a legal standpoint is a collection of tax and legal benefits which are provided to incentivize certain behavior. Particularly, they are provided to incentivize the creation of a family and the production of babies.Gay marriage does not result in babies, typically. Certainly not in large quantities. Most often it results in adoption of children who are already born - and even more to the point, those people would have almost certainly adopted without the legal benefits we provide married couples.To keep this short, since I have class in a few hours and really ought to be asleep, if I were to take this position I would say that tax benefits should be provided to people who are most likely to give us what we\'re actually trying to incentivize and at this time gay marriage will not do so.In reality I do not feel like this is a strong enough argument to justify the immorality of denying a section of the population the legal standing of marriage.", bewertung:"0"}

{text:"I\'m going to describe this in a highly sterile/economic fashion, so please don\'t be insulted when I make generalizations and refer to people as essentially commodities.  Marriage is love and shiny happy feelings, but it is also economics and numbers.Until very recently, throughout human history, even in cultures where homosexuality was not overly stigmatized, homosexual marriage has never really been practiced on any real scale.  Now just because we\'ve always done it one way, doesn\'t mean we shouldn\'t consider doing it another way, ask yourself why historically no culture ever decided to extend formal legal protection to homosexual unions.  For that matter why are governments concerned with marriage at all?  The answer ultimately is that governments, religious or secular, both want to encourage the creation of new citizens, and to protect women and children.    In the old days sex carried with it the constant risk of pregnancy, which is why waiting for marriage was a much bigger deal.  If you weren\'t married there was no way to prove who was responsible for the child.  Orphans and unwed mothers historically were a problem in virtually every society.  Without a man to support them, they ultimately would become a burden on the state.  Marriage is an excellent way to guarantee legal rights to children, because it obligates men to support them.  It also prevented men from simply casting women aside after they were bored with them, or after their child rearing years were past.  Marriage gave both children and women the legal right to be supported by the husband and father.Historically, in exchange for taking upon himself the legal obligation of supporting a woman and all of the offspring which sprang forth from said woman, the man gained exclusive sexual access to his wife, and the complete control of his children until they came of age, which in farming and many other trades meant excellent free labor.  The women and children get support, the man gets a family and additional labor, and the state gets excellent new citizens raised in strong family units.  Families were literally the building block of societies historically.Now try to apply this model to homosexuals.  Homosexuals don\'t naturally produce children, so the state isn\'t interested.  Homosexuals didn\'t have to wait for marriage to have sex because their sex wasn\'t going to result in any unwanted pregnancy.  As a result one homosexual isn\'t conventionally obligated to support the other, as neither party is considered more vulnerable than the other, so neither party was particularly interested in getting married either.  In ancient Greece, many homosexuals would have their men on the side in the city, and then go home to their wives who were tending to the children and farm at home.  Many men, if they wanted to be successful would take a wife and raise children, no matter what his sexual preference, because you couldn\'t run a farm by yourself.  Also a man or woman who died without an heir was considered a failure.Now in modern times, things have changed.  Women are no longer completely dependent on their husbands, and can earn their own support if they choose.  Husbands no longer essentially own their wives  and children after marriage.  Men also don\'t have to marry most women in order to gain sexual access to them, and if proper precautions are taken the risk of unwanted children can be greatly reduced.  Also paternity testing takes all the fun out of guessing who is the father of an unmarried woman\'s baby.  While this is better in many ways it is also worse in some.  People, both men and women, don\'t have the incentive to marry they once did.  More children are born out of wedlock, which ultimately is often still a burden on society, and children raised in single parent homes statistically have more problems.  For better or worse, marriage is becoming less popular in western society.  People are marrying later in life, or not at all.  Children are not being produced at the same rate as competing cultures. Now the real question in my mind is why should we encourage homosexuals to marry?  Times have changed, but not in a way that gives society any benefit from encouraging homosexuals to marry.  Modern Marriage in many ways is a subsidy.  Better tax rates for the married.  But why should we subsidize behavior that isn\'t going to yield the desired benefit (children)?  From the governments point of view they may as well be giving roommates a tax break, just for being roommates.  Now I know homosexuals can adopt, but if we\'re trying to incentivize adoption, it makes more sense to incentivize adoption directly, and not grant anyone that subsidy before they actually adopt.There is also the subject of bisexuality to consider.  We often forget, that while most of us think in terms of straight and gay, bisexuals actually outnumber homosexuals considerably.  Bisexuals represent a group that the government can essentially influence in their marriage preference.  If a person can choose between one lifestyle/relationship that will produce children, and one that will not, the government actually has an incentive to encourage bisexuals to marry the opposite sex and breed.  Most homosexuals really want the benefits of legal marriage, not just for economic, but for social acceptance reasons.  This is completely understandable, and while I empathize with their feelings, it doesn\'t make gay marriage make any more sense logically or socio-economically.Honestly the only logical reason I can think of to allow gay marriage isn\'t really logical at all.  Popular opinion.  If the majority of people want it, then by all means let them have it, even if it isn\'t arguably the best thing for society.  Still, people should be allowed to discuss the pros and cons in a rational respectful manner, without being called inhuman and accused of bigotry, simply for espousing a traditional opinion that the vast majority of the world\'s population still thinks is correct.  Also please understand that I bear homosexuals no ill will.  Being straight or gay has no bearing on whether or not you are a wonderful person, and I know many absolutely wonderful homosexuals.  Anyone who would attempt to hurt another person physically for their sexual preference is an inhuman fool.  ", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"It depends upon how you define the term \"marriage\".  I tend to think of it in it\'s \"traditional\" terms: a religious ceremony which two people have to go through in order to have permission to have sex.  Lets just for the moment ignore the whole wedding dowry/women are property thing and focus upon the idea that this ceremony involves two people asking to have to have the OK to have sex based on moral grounds, because sex outside of marriage is a sin, from a priest who was probably most likely abusing the choir boys sickens me.Whilst I recognise that gays are looking for public/legal recognition of their relationship but I still think it comes back to that traditional definition of marriage and I feel (perhaps irrationally, I admit!) that homosexuals getting married somehow reinforces this \"begging the church for permission\" idea.  The marriage rights that gays are fighting for stem from those religious institutions which seek to encourage people to \"fall in line\" by offering marriage benefits (tax benefits, etc) and so I\'ll always feel that marriage between anyone reinforces a religious institution\'s power over people.  Even people who don\'t believe in god absolutely must get married in a church (= money for the church).In short, I feel that marriage is the primary way that churches/synagoges/mosques have power over people and it\'s a hold that won\'t ever go away until people (all people) reject the concept of marriage.", bewertung:"0"}
