{text:"My ma reasoned that the purpose of a marriage is to facilitate having kids, and starting a family. She doesn\'t believe in allowing gay couples to adopt because she reckons that puts the child at a disadvantage in not having a normal mother and father, which adopted kids need more because their lives are already so disrupted, it wouldn\'t be fair to allow kids to go to same sex couples where they wouldn\'t have a mother in some cases.I disagree with that reasoning since kids grow up in many kinds of family environments and so long as there\'s love there, the kids will be OK, but I am willing to accept the validity of her point, that its not entirely bigoted.", bewertung:"1"}
{text:"Ok, since were not likely to get a good answer to this due to the liberal leanings of most of us here, I\'m going to guess some of the no campaigns arguments that we\'ll see in the lead up to the referendum. Chime in if you can think of some more.• Slippery slope: If gays can get married, it\'s a slippery slope to  polygamy, child brides, people marrying inanimate objects, etc.• Think of the children: If gays can get married, they\'ll want to adopt, and [insert study here] shows us that it\'s an unsuitable environment for kids to be raised in. Kids will be bullied if they have two daddies/mammies.• It will undermine traditional man-woman marriages. • Same-sex partners will force priests to perform church weddings, and this is religious persecution.• Something something constitution, DeValera and the patriots turning in their graves.• Bible.• It\'s unnatural, and would encourage an unhealthy lifestyle.", bewertung:"0"}

{text:"The only reason I consider acceptable for being against it is that you believe marriage is fundamentally a catholic or Christian sacrament. Thus, it cannot be \"marriage\" and should not be called \"marriage\".  I disagree with this position (\"well, it\'s not a Christian marriage, it\'s a neo-religious or non-religious marriage\"), but I am just about tolerant to it since it *should* allow for legally-identical unions - which cover next-of-kin, inheritance, power of attorney, et. al", bewertung:"-1"}

{text:"From what I\'ve seen in real life (not reddit) people either really want marriage equality or don\'t give a shit. That may just be my age group though (college students). Reading through this thread people seem confused about the difference between religious marriage and civil marriage. Just want to throw out there that they\'re not the same thing, and this referendum would not force priests to do marriage ceremonies for the gays. I haven\'t seen any other arguments that are worth much, but I am curious if anyone has one...", bewertung:"1"}
{text:"I believe voting NO may be the right thing to do. Here\'s why:The state provides civil partnership. Everyone has the right to this already, whatever your sexual orientation. Marriage is just purely religious affair. In law, it\'s just another civil partnership but instead of a register officer, the state authorises the priest to do it on behalf of the state. It is just a religious label placed on your regular civil partnership that has no extra legal effect other than changing the word \"civl partnership\" to \"marriage\" (for people who believe in god I\'m sure it\'s more than this). The state and church are separate but this goes both ways. I won\'t want the church making laws in Ireland like banning condoms that affect me, but I don\'t expect to be able to change religious laws because I don\'t agree with them. (I don\'t agree with a lot of religious practices) If you\'re not happy with the lack of same sex marriage, you should blame your religion and not drag the state into it. If you sign up to be a catholic, then you agree to their rules. If you don\'t like it, don\'t sign up.Write to your bishop, or your priest. If anything the referendum should be to remove the word \"marriage\" from law as it\'s a religious term and doesn\'t belong on the books of a secular state. If we all just said \"civil partnership\" instead of \"marriage\" , this wouldn\'t even be an issue. It\'s  a referendum over a silly name.- Nah wait I just read up on that http://www.marriagequality.ie/  website. Looks like I\'m wrong on the internet.Turns out I was thinking of the UK, not Ireland. Looks like the Irish government don\'t recognise the rights between children and non biological parents in a same sex civil partnership That\'s totally wrong. Needs to be changed.", bewertung:"-1"}
