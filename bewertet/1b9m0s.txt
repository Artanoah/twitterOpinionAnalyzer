{text:"**NOTE:** Playing Devil\'s Advocate. I\'m actually opposed to marriage as a legal institution in general, but if it must be upheld, it should not discriminate by sexual preference.Additional financial strain on the government. If you\'re married and your spouse dies, you\'re able to collect on his or her Social Security, whereas if you\'re not married, the account is forfeit. Likewise, your spouse can collect on your military pension, if you leave behind a widow or widower. Gay marriage means more people collecting on an already failing Social Security system, as well as increased military spending, for pensions paid out to husbands and wives of the deceased.The reason I say I\'m opposed to marriage is that a lot of marriage benefits were enacted in an entirely different cultural context: at the time, a married woman was always a stay-at-home mother who would have had little or no work experience and, consequently, no means to support her family, in the event of her husband\'s death. Collecting on her husband\'s Social Security and military pension were provided as ways for her to make ends meet. At a time when single parents are becoming more common and women are almost as likely to work as men, such policies are no longer necessary and seem discriminatory especially toward single parents (who ultimately pay more in taxes to fund those marriage benefits).At any rate, if marriage were not treated as a legal institution, then the government would not have be involved in determining who\'s allowed to get married.", bewertung:"0"}
