{text:"Literally my first post ever, but this is one that I\'m passionate about. Took that much to get me out of my shell, I guess. I am a devout follower of Christ, and the hypocrisy the church commits near constantly offends me more than I can really express here, so for that I deeply apologize. I did my senior capstone project on an analysis of the evolution of the church from ancient times to the first century church to modern day, including lots of fascinating things such as exegesis, breaking of denomination, etc. (sarcasm). I got a bible degree, with psych and education minors. Specifically referencing the portion discussing homosexuality in the church I researched brought me to a unique conclusion, and it is very unpopular among my peers:  Homosexuality has been a sin due exclusively to the inability to have sexual relations within a legally recognized union. Now that it is legal, that must change. The only sin found in homosexuality is the one of sexual intercourse outside of marriage. The introduction of a legal marriage option removes the only sin, so there must be other reasons why the church rejects homosexuality.The reason so many people feel homosexuality is so unacceptable is because it is an act of sexual deviance. If the median sexual action is between a man and a woman, homosexual sex deviates from that. Not that this is necessarily wrong, but it is objectively true. That being said, many people group this particular form of sexual deviance with all others, such as rape, incest, pedophilia, etc. This sheds an unfortunate, and inaccurate light on the view the general population of the church has towards homosexuality. As mentioned before, the idea of a man having sex with a man is gross to most straight men, so that discomfort combined with the idea of being similar (again, misconception) to rape or molestation, leads people to reject it, then to follow up by citing bible verses out of context to support it. This presents a larger problem than whether gay marriage should be allowed. Another larger issue is how the church deals with homosexuality. If, contrary to my findings, a church decides homosexuality IS a sin, it becomes their responsibility to react to that sin with love and inclusion, not with exclusion and loftiness. Did Jesus, the one we claim to model our belief structure after, ever avoid someone in his ministry because of their sins? No. He ate with them, taught them, loved them. He is called friend to sinners for a reason. Why should the church behave differently? So while I personally do not feel homosexuality is a sin, if it were, it is NO different than any other member of the church, and not including homosexuals is just as much of a sin as them hypocritically claiming homosexuality is.TLDR  From a biblical perspective, whether homosexuality is a sin or not isn\'t clear, but the need to love homosexuals the same as any other perceived sinner is. The church is wrong for excluding homosexuals. ", bewertung:"1"}
{text:"Morally, I am not for gay marriage. It definitely goes against my Christian beliefs. I can not say, and reconcile, gay marriage within the purview of my beliefs. However, gay unions should definitely be allowed, with all the same benefits and restrictions as heterosexual marriage. Jesus was loving of all walks of life, the prostitutes, the tax collectors, the dregs of society. As an American, we hold all men are created equal. Withholding that privilege from a group of people based on sexuality seems wrong on a lawful level. TL;DR I don\'t support gay marriage on a moral level, but on a lawful level I am for it. And as a Christian, I find it better to love on people rather then judge and condemn. EDIT: I don\'t think homosexuals are the dregs of society, I was saying that God loves even the worst, so why should Christians not love homosexuals. Also: The government should just stop recognizing marriage, change it to a civil union, let the church \"marry\" people. All parties should be happy. ", bewertung:"-1"}
{text:"I\'m not necessarily opposed to gay marriage being made legal. If a country wants to legalize it because people want it, it should, because it\'s a democracy.My issue with gay marriage is more cultural. I don\'t like how it\'s trying to lay claim to an exclusively heterosexual cultural ritual as some kind of human right being denied them. It is not. It\'s a cultural rite of passage that arose in and is exclusive to a specific segment of society, just like the bar mitvah, baptism, or confirmation. Marriage sprung up as a means of curbing illegitimacy in the heterosexual world, transitioning a girl into womanhood and motherhood, and transitioning a man into manhood and fatherhood. Why do you think the father walks the bride down the aisle? He is officially letting go of his \"little girl\" and giving her away to be the \"woman\" to the new man in his life, who now \"owns\" her. She becomes that \"woman\" and gets \"owned\" by her husband by losing her virginity on the night of her honeymoon and giving him lots of babies. I know, I know, it\'s tacky at how old-fashioned and sexist this all is, but this is how and why marriage developed. What does this cultural rite of passage have to do with being gay, when so much of it is based on heterosexuality, right down to the symbolic gesture of one man (father) giving a young woman away to another man (husband)? Nothing. Why is it being seen as some kind of \"human right\"? It shouldn\'t. It is what it is-- a heterosexual ritual, just as Communion is a Catholic ritual or Sweet 16 a one for little girls or whatever-- and segments of society have the right to preserve their rituals without people attacking them for being bigoted or narrow-minded because they don\'t see the *logic* of extending it to people other than for whom it was intended.So this is my issue with gay marriage in a nutshell. Gay people have every right to be seen as part of a legal union. But trying to get everyone to accept it on a cultural level as  \"marriage?\" Doesn\'t make any sense.", bewertung:"-1"}
{text:"*Sorry for the long post...*Just as a heads-up, I\'m a Christian father of two, in my mid-twenties. Should give some context. I\'ve been doing a lot of soul searching lately, as this issue seems to be a defining one in our times, and I\'m still trying to come up with a concrete answer. But here are my thoughts.First, as a devoted Christian, I take the Bible seriously. WHen it explicitly calls something *sin*, I treat it as such, despite my personal hang-ups and equivocations. I know, many argue that this could be a \"cultural\" issue, that homosexuality was deemed as unclean in the time of the writing of the Bible, that this fits into instructions like \"do not wear jewelry.\" However, homosexuality was just as accepted in those days, if not more... Just look at Greek and Roman lifestyles (which is who these letters in the Bible were being written to...) So I can\'t imagine this is actually something that is just culturally irrelevant now. It\'s sin... My belief anyway.Also, as a parent, I mostly get up in arms about my kids, growing up in a world where something I see as wrong is widely accepted and encouraged. I fear for having to explain to what sex is to my girls, because homosexuality was brought up at school. I don\'t want their first inkling of sexuality to be addressed in kindergarten when their teachers talk about how having two daddies or two mamas is just as healthy as a mama and a daddy... I don\'t want them to grow up having to answer questions for themselves that I never had to ask, at a younger age than I ever thought about. I just fear for my kids\' safety and little perfect world that I try so hard to set up.THAT SAID...When I look at the person of Jesus, I can\'t help but see someone who unconditionally loves those around him. He extended grace. He did not judge. He realized people hurt, and have pain, and he said that was okay. If you look at his life, you see the only people that Jesus ever really criticized were the religious, self-important moralizers. Seem familiar...? Us Christians traditionally suck at actually doing what Jesus did and said. On behalf of all of us, I\'m sorry.  I think if Jesus was walking the earth right now, he\'d be ashamed by a lot of people who call themselves Christians. Possibly myself included.I want to protect my kids. That\'s a good thing. But doing it at the expense of loving my fellow man? Nope. Not okay. Jesus calls us believers to sacrifice ourselves, daily. Give up our comfort, our safety, our *personal preferences*... Set them aside, and just love people. With Jesus\' help, I\'m learning to do that, day by day.TL;DR: morally against gay marriage, not politically at all. Afraid for my kids\' future. Not a good enough excuse though, when I look at the life of Jesus. Learning to love and accept others.**EDIT: Figured I\'d answer some FAQs**&gt;What will you do if your children end up living a homosexual lifestyle? Have you thought about that?I definitely have. A lot. I believe in unconditional love. At leastI aspire to it. I\'ll love my kids, regardless of their actions, attitudes, or beliefs... Even if I disagree. I respect them, their right to make informed life choices... Even if I disagree. The most important thing is not being right, but demonstrating love and grace. No doubt, it\'d be hard and difficult, but I am 100% commuted to not driving my kids away, even if I know it\'s sin. Reality check: we all sin. All Christian\'s everywhere have sinned, and continue to do so on a daily basis. Not that it OK\'s it, (Romans 5-8) but it demonstrates our daily need for Christ.&gt;What about all the \"other\" sins that are forbidden in Scripture? Seems like Christians pick and choose what they want to believe...There\'s just some general confusion on this. In the New Testament, Jesus said he \"came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it.\" He didn\'t negate the laws written in the Old Testament, but rather to bring them to completion. As a basic overview, in the Old Testament (OT), there were *many* laws laid out. Most all of them were ceremonial in nature (how to perform sacrifices, rites, rituals, many cultural things to set the Jewish people apart from other cultures in their day), but other laws were considered moral laws (think the Ten Commandments) and there were far fewer of these. What Jesus meant by saying he came not to abolish the law but to fulfill it, he is saying that the ceremonial law is done, as believing in Christ is now the way to be in relationship with God, Christ\'s blood being the sacrifice that gets us there. However, the moral laws are even tighter and are set as a higher standard. For instance:*Matthew 5:27-28 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.* We\'re now called to a higher standard based on our intentions and motivations, not just outward behavior... Hard stuff. So, to respond, it\'s not that we arbitrarily pick and choose what is sin and what isn\'t. Rather some is applicable and some isn\'t... And a lot of it is up for debate. But I think I can affirm that most honest Christians have come to a general consensus of what constitutes a ceremonial law versus something that is moral in nature. Homosexuality would be something regarded very much as a break in the moral law. Again, just my opinion and understanding.&gt;What about shellfish? What about mixed fabrics? Etc, etcI\'ll just answer with this: Mark 7:14-23 \"Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.” After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. “Are you so dull?” he asked. “Don’t you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them? For it doesn’t go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body.” (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)He went on: “What comes out of a person is what defiles them. For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.  All these evils come from inside and defile a person.”&gt;But it\'s still sin! Don\'t condone the sinful act. It\'s truly loving to tell them what they are doing is wrong!I firmly believe that can only effectively be related in the form of relationship. No homosexual EVER has been reached by the Westboro Baptist Church. They push people out, keeping them at arms length, judging and hating. Christ would meet them where they are, then in love and kindness, confront their sin. The person in question could reject that, surely... But isn\'t Christ and his love infinitely more compelling than judgment and hate?", bewertung:"1"}

Just don\'t get married in a church that is associated with some religious institution that actively prohibits homosexuality.

I just believe it to be a habitual sin and because of this I don\'t believe someone can be actively gay and still be a Christian. Same as someone who refuses to give up any kind of sin. It\'s not so much the fact that it\'s homosexuality it\'s the fact that they are refusing God\'s will. Not saying it\'s worse than other sins as I believe all sins are equal but I believe those that we continue to practice and refuse to give up separate us from God and do not allow us to be a Christian.

Sex is:\"The U.S. courts use the words \"sex\" and \"gender\" interchangeably in legal contexts, but medicine and academia generally use them to distinguish between biology and the psychosocial manifestations of that biology. \"Sex\" includes the cellular materials that make up the sexual anatomy and physiology of a human being, including:    Chromosomes    Genes    The cellular machinery for controlling the genetic material and its expression as RNA and protein    Gonads    Genitals    Other reproductive organs    Hormones    Hormone receptors    Secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts and facial hair    Brain (the most important factor)\"To quote from that HuffPo article.  This means that transwomen, on the level of Sex (not gender) not only are not Male, but never were Male in the first place.  This assertion is empirically verified in the pastebin links in every way conceivable almost.People claiming that transsexuals/transgenders are mentally ill, however well meaning they claim to be, are categorically false, and show a very sore lack of understanding of basic biology as it makes up Sex (not gender).", bewertung:"0"}

Why should child custody rights have to do with anything but evaluating who has taken care of that child?I do not think that even heterosexual marriages should be a legal thing. They should simply be a spiritual thing, something between you, your spouse, and God. Those who don\'t want that should not feel they need to get married because they\'re losing out on rights.

{text:"To me, proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage are arguing on two different tracks, which is why the debate rarely goes anywhere.I think SSM is a bad idea, but to really understand why is going to require some patient consideration.First, for opponents of SSM, fundamental premise is that the lifelong, exclusive union of a man and a woman is a uniquely important relationship that is worthy of special treatment. From this perspective, the argument is that this particular kind of union is worth singling out for a sort of positive discrimination - a bit like charitable donations are singled out for favourable tax treatment.Why single out the lifelong, exclusive male-female union? Well for a few reasons. First, the male-female aspect of the relationship is biologically unique and significant in a profoundly existential way. It is how our species remains in existence. If you think that human existence is important, then it follows that the biological union that facilitates human existence is also important. You can recognise this regardless of your sexual orientation, and many people do.Secondly, the lifelong, exclusive union is uniquely important in this context because it creates a strong framework within which children can be nurtured into responsible, pro-social adulthood (and so the cycle continues).Eseentially what I have described is an ideal. For proponents of \"traditional\" marriage like me, the point of male-female marriage laws as we know them is to propel heterosexual relations towards this ideal for the benefit of children and of society, and hopefully the couple too.You\'ll notice I put the beneift of the couple last in that list. That\'s not an accident. The idea of a lifelong, exclusive union assumes there will be a degree of self-sacrifice in a successful marriage, whereby the couple put the interests of their children and of society ahead of their own individual interests (for example, their interest in pursuing other sexual relationships). That\'s why the traditional formulations of marriage vows don\'t focus on how the couple FEEL about each other on the day - they focus on the hardy reality of a lifelong union: richer or poorer, sickness and health, for better or worse.That last one is a real humdinger. To promise to be faithful to someone til death, even if it\'s for WORSE.Why go to such lengths? Well if marriage is actually not just about the couple, but about the role they are about to play in the creation of another generation of humans, then the union they are entering into is best served with a healthy side of foresight and responsibility for all that that entails.None of the above denigrates same-sex-attracted people. It merely points out that there is a unique and profound significance to the male-female union (reproduction) and that it is uniquely advantageous to encourage reproduction to take place within a context of lifelong, mutual commitment.This is just the tip of the iceberg, and this iceberg goes DEEP. There are many arguments and counter-arguments and counter-counter arguments, but they rarely see the light of day because it is so hard to talk about this issue without passions becoming inflamed.For example, many people see this argument and jump straight to either \"but gay people have babies too!\" or \"thanks for explaining why infertile people shouldn\'t be allowed to marry.\" The responses to these kinds of legitimate points would each require a post about as long as this one.I also haven\'t delved into counter arguments to the most prominent pro-SSM arguments, because I want to go to sleep.As someone who has wrestled with this issue long and hard, I\'m not really interested in changing anyone\'s opinion. But I would like to see the proponents of SSM acknowledging that it\'s not all about homophobia (even though for some people that\'s all there is to it) and that just MAYBE there are some thoughtful folk out there who oppose SSM for quite reasonable reasons, without condoning any disparagement or denigration of the people most affected by this issue.", bewertung:"0"}

{text:"OK, probably getting downvotes for unpopular opinion, but I\'m gonna be brutally honest.I was opposing gay marriage until recently. I came up with reasons such as \"they cannot reproduce\" etc. but in fact that was just all farce. I will come out to you. The reason I was against it was out of pure hatred and disgust.To me gay people were the people who would put their penises in an asshole every day and would thus spread AIDS. Undeniably gays have a higher chance of having and spreading AIDS. I am disgusted at this and wanted to \"punish\" gays by withholding something from them. I would come up with various reasons, but in core I just wanted to annoy and punish them.I have realized recently how childish this is and now my stance is that it is none of my business. Live and let live. I actually support gay marriage now if asked.You might hate me for saying something about penises, buttholes and AIDS, but I think deep inside this disgust towards gays is what makes people come up with reasons against gay marriage.Edit: WOW!

{text:"The supreme court of Iowa asked exactly the same question in a high-profile civil rights case:http://www.iowacourts.gov/wfData/files/Varnum/07-1499(1).pdfThey got these five replies, which presumably are the best that a large, well-funded legal effort could muster:**Tradition is important, and banning gay marriage maintains tradition.** The court rejected this as circular reasoning, rather than an actual reason, and noted that it applies equally well to, say, interracial marriage.**Children are important, and banning gay marriage promotes an optimal environment for raising them.** Now, this one is not quite as trivial as the previous one, since taking care of children is actually a valid objective. However, the evidence is pretty clear that there\'s not a significant difference in outcomes in child-rearing, and even though some amount of uncertainty always remains, it\'s dangerous to ban things based on vague suspicions. And then, of course, there are plenty of other groups of people who you might want to ban from marrying on this criterion: sex offenders, say, or people who\'d been convicted of violent crimes. And what the hell is up with banning gay *marriage* rather than gay *parenthood?* The court concluded that this argument is obviously not the real reason, but just some after-the-fact bullshit rationalization.**Banning gay marriage will raise birth rates somehow. Babies babies babies.** The court rejected this argument as making not a lick of sense. \"The briefs, the record, our research, and common sense do not suggest such an outcome.\" They quickly move on to the next argument:**Banning gay marriage will promote the stability of straight marriages.** Rejected for being, as far as the court could tell, completely unsupported by any kind of evidence.**Marriage costs the government money, so banning gay marriage is thrifty.** This argument applies equally well to banning marriage among any group of people.

{text:"It should not be understood as gay marriage (ie marriage for gays) but marriage that includes gays (ie the marriage is the same for all and is extended to gays), which is different. Because in the first case, it is something specific to gays and one would be wondering why it should be of any concern of any other people. In the second case, it is a communal good whose definition is changed by the inclusion of an extra group. This extension changes the definition for every one and thus everyone has a right to have a word on the matter.It is not the business of Canadians to decide how Mexicans define themselves, but it would become Canadians\' business if suddenly Mexicans were to claim that they are Canadians.That\'s to first answer the objection that gay marriage doesn\'t do anything to other people\'s marriage. People have to understand what marriage is initially about. Marriage is not about recognizing a couple\'s love or whatever romantic BS that came about in the 20th century.Marriage is initially a way to assign paternity to a man because for the longest time, there was no way to know who the father of a child was. Marriage allowed to assign paternity: the husband is the father, period. Fatherhood has always been - until paternity tests - a strictly social role, unlike motherhood which is both a biological and a social role. Yep, there is an unavoidable biological fact at the origin of marriage...Why is it important to assign paternity? Well, it is only important in SOME societies, ie, those where children are brought up by their parents (which, unless people reject basic science - which happens often in the USA - must be a male and a female ever since sexual reproduction came to be). Some societies function with a communal type of upbringing, or other types, but not western societies. This is actually changing indeed and some people can regret that, just like one can object to polygamy which works perfectly well in many countries around the world.Most people seem to not realise that marriage actually protect women, because, as anyone can see regarding single parents, it is women that are abandoned with the children, rarely the other way around. It is actually why marriage became a religious sacrament in medieval Europe (yes, for the first thousand years of Christianity, marriage was a least bad solution, but certainly not something worth praising): marriage allowed women to not be repudiated anymore by forcing men to keep their wives (the Church fought hard on that, even with kings, cf. Robbert II of France), which used to leave them destitute and with kids (so overall not good for society). There is a biological barrier there: women bear children, men don\'t. Having a child for a man is only a fuck. Not the case for women, so it is not surprising that they end up with the kids most of the time. Flash forward to nowadays. The thing is, marriage has, in practice, lost its use: people don\'t even realize why it\'s there anymore (they\'ll say it\'s to celebrate their love and whatnot), and women get repudiated in practice (single parents are mostly women). Another thing thing that will have a tremendous anthropological change: paternity test. Now paternity has become exactly like maternity: a link founded by biology. This people, you won\'t see the end of it.Now it is not because practice differs from theory that theory should be discarded. One can regret that people are not polite anymore. Should we ditch politeness just because people aren\'t? The existence of a norm, even if it is not followed, still gives an idea of collective values. It was the case with marriage: although no longer the case in practice, it was an institution that was the foundation of the nuclear family.So what has gay marriage got to do with all that? Well gay marriage is the nail in the coffin. By definition, a gay couple is infertile, hence the automatic follow-up to gay marriage: surrogate mothers, artificial insemination without medical cause, etc. So with a marriage that includes gays, now there is not even a pretension - as for infertile heterosexual couples or couples who didn\'t want kids - to have anything to do with recognition of paternity.True, the practice of modern monogamous marriage has been far from what the theory was originally (so much that the theory is different for many people). So in effect, gay marriage is the recognition of the demise of marriage. That is why the argument that gay marriage doesn\'t do anything to other people is wrong: it does. It\'s the official end of what marriage as a norm has been because it has changed the meaning of the norm. So gay marriage destroys the norm of what marriage was (ie the framework of family) - and I have to stress that for people who will have a hard time understanding: gay marriage didn\'t destroy the practice, it\'s been in tatters for a while now.It heralds the new meaning of marriage (love, love, love). But noone needs marriage to love. Since you don\'t need marriage to be a father either any more(thanks paternity test), then marriage has no more meaning and as such, should be an institution that should now be discarded, like jousting, dueling, engagement ceremonies, etc.If marriage is what gay marriage is, then what use does it have? The family has no use of it anymore and indeed many countries in Europe have already seen a steep decline of marriage because it doesn\'t serve any purpose in practice when you have collective systems in place to take care of women and their children. If it is to \"publicly show your love\" etc. then just do your fancy ceremony, no need to involve officials in it.**tl;dr: gay marriage is the unplugging of marriage while some wanted to try to keep it alive.**", bewertung:"0"}

{text:"I was hoping for some interesting arguments, but I really think the responses here have strengthened my opinion that gay couples should be allowed to marry.  It seems the majority of the responses are:1. Procreation argument - a primary objective of marriage is procreation, and gays can\'t procreate.  But no one has that I\'ve seen, provided a sufficient response to the counter-argument that if this were true, sterile couples, or those with no intention of reproducing should not have the same legal marriage rights as those couples with children.  Most people think these heterosexual couples should still be able to legally marry.2. People think marriage is not something the government should be involved in, and that allowing gay marriage just furthers this idea.  But pretty much everyone that is making this argument concedes that this is a more general objection to our current institution.  For the record, I agree that the state should not be involved in the institution of marriage, but while they do (especially while they do), I think marriage equality is a constitutional right.3. Children are more likely to become well-acclimated members of society/have a higher well-being if they are raised by heterosexual couples than if by homosexual couples, aka that a child is best raised by a father and a mother.  As far as I can find, there hasn\'t been a ton of long-running, extensive research on this, but what we do know is that there isn\'t much evidence that a child raised in a heterosexual marriage will be better off (2013 study by Tufts, for example), and some have even concluded the contrary, that children raised by homosexual parents could be more likely to better adapt to society (see 2010 study by academics at UCSF/UCLA in the journal \'Pediatrics\').4. We have defined marriage traditionally as being between a man and a woman, and we shouldn\'t change that, in the spirit of maintaining tradition.  I think most reasonable people would strongly disagree with this idea, when you look at how far we\'ve come in terms of gender and racial equality, and even back to things like slavery. Being able to progress and change things we see as \"wrong\" is a cornerstone of democracy and we should always be trying to improve our society if we have any investment in its success and the success of its people.5. Homosexual unions are contrary to some religious beliefs.  Whether or not it should be (again, I think not), marriage is a legal institution, so religious guidelines are irrelevant in this context.  These religions may also dictate that you shouldn\'t have sex before marriage, but it is not illegal to do so.  If marriage were purely a religious institution, I may be more inclined to oppose the religious marriage of homosexuals.6. Emotional opposition to homosexuality in general.  I get it, some people are extremely uncomfortable with the whole idea of homosexuality, but that again is irrelevant in this context.  They would argue that homosexuals are in some way disabled or have some sort of abnormal condition, which is merely an opinion and, somewhat related to (5), should have no effect on our current, legal institution that we have created.Have I missed any other significant arguments? I\'m genuinely interested in hearing various ideologies, but so far I\'ve not seen anything that\'s even made me question my support for marriage equality for homosexuals.Edit- though it may not seem so, my post wasn\'t to try to push my opinion or change the minds of people with their own ideas, but actually the contrary, I want to understand the arguments people are making so I can use them to further my own understanding to reform my own opinion.", bewertung:"1"}

What if a trio of consenting adults in a polygamous relationship wanted to all be married to each other? A lot of people, even open minded people who don\'t care at all that they\'re polygamous, would say \'but that\'s not what marriage is, marriage is between two people\'. I think non-religious people who object to gay marriage have a similar outlook: \'but that\'s not what marriage is, marriage is between a man and a woman\'. It\'s more semantics and the legal and social meaning of the word and the institution. IMO. ", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"I\'m not atheist and I do believe in gay marriage, but I\'m going to throw my 2c out there because it might be of related interest.For a long time I didn\'t believe in gay marriage, and it wasn\'t a Christianity thing even though I identify loosely as Christian, and in my younger days was devout. (Most of the homophobic content in the bible is socially driven - eg the prohibition on male-male temple prostitution). I felt that marriage had evolved spontaneously and hetero-centrically in many societies over many millennia, and it wasn\'t our place to mess with that. I had no problem with civil unions but I felt that marriage should be left as it was. It was basically an anthropological argument.So what changed my mind? Firstly becoming aware that there had been various kinds of same-sex marriage through history. Second, that some very different societies with very different influences were starting to be in favour of it at the same time. At that point I reconsidered and reached the conclusion that gay marriage was part of a spontaneous evolution of marriage as a cultural artefact, and not a socially-engineered imposition.

{text:"Devil\'s advocate, as I am every time this comes up:Marriage from a legal standpoint is a collection of tax and legal benefits which are provided to incentivize certain behavior. Particularly, they are provided to incentivize the creation of a family and the production of babies.Gay marriage does not result in babies, typically. Certainly not in large quantities. Most often it results in adoption of children who are already born - and even more to the point, those people would have almost certainly adopted without the legal benefits we provide married couples.To keep this short, since I have class in a few hours and really ought to be asleep, if I were to take this position I would say that tax benefits should be provided to people who are most likely to give us what we\'re actually trying to incentivize and at this time gay marriage will not do so.In reality I do not feel like this is a strong enough argument to justify the immorality of denying a section of the population the legal standing of marriage.", bewertung:"0"}

{text:"I\'m going to describe this in a highly sterile/economic fashion, so please don\'t be insulted when I make generalizations and refer to people as essentially commodities.  Marriage is love and shiny happy feelings, but it is also economics and numbers.Until very recently, throughout human history, even in cultures where homosexuality was not overly stigmatized, homosexual marriage has never really been practiced on any real scale.  Now just because we\'ve always done it one way, doesn\'t mean we shouldn\'t consider doing it another way, ask yourself why historically no culture ever decided to extend formal legal protection to homosexual unions.  For that matter why are governments concerned with marriage at all?  The answer ultimately is that governments, religious or secular, both want to encourage the creation of new citizens, and to protect women and children.    In the old days sex carried with it the constant risk of pregnancy, which is why waiting for marriage was a much bigger deal.  If you weren\'t married there was no way to prove who was responsible for the child.  Orphans and unwed mothers historically were a problem in virtually every society.  Without a man to support them, they ultimately would become a burden on the state.  Marriage is an excellent way to guarantee legal rights to children, because it obligates men to support them.  It also prevented men from simply casting women aside after they were bored with them, or after their child rearing years were past.  Marriage gave both children and women the legal right to be supported by the husband and father.Historically, in exchange for taking upon himself the legal obligation of supporting a woman and all of the offspring which sprang forth from said woman, the man gained exclusive sexual access to his wife, and the complete control of his children until they came of age, which in farming and many other trades meant excellent free labor.  The women and children get support, the man gets a family and additional labor, and the state gets excellent new citizens raised in strong family units.  Families were literally the building block of societies historically.Now try to apply this model to homosexuals.  Homosexuals don\'t naturally produce children, so the state isn\'t interested.  Homosexuals didn\'t have to wait for marriage to have sex because their sex wasn\'t going to result in any unwanted pregnancy.  As a result one homosexual isn\'t conventionally obligated to support the other, as neither party is considered more vulnerable than the other, so neither party was particularly interested in getting married either.  In ancient Greece, many homosexuals would have their men on the side in the city, and then go home to their wives who were tending to the children and farm at home.  Many men, if they wanted to be successful would take a wife and raise children, no matter what his sexual preference, because you couldn\'t run a farm by yourself.  Also a man or woman who died without an heir was considered a failure.Now in modern times, things have changed.  Women are no longer completely dependent on their husbands, and can earn their own support if they choose.  Husbands no longer essentially own their wives  and children after marriage.  Men also don\'t have to marry most women in order to gain sexual access to them, and if proper precautions are taken the risk of unwanted children can be greatly reduced.  Also paternity testing takes all the fun out of guessing who is the father of an unmarried woman\'s baby.  While this is better in many ways it is also worse in some.  People, both men and women, don\'t have the incentive to marry they once did.  More children are born out of wedlock, which ultimately is often still a burden on society, and children raised in single parent homes statistically have more problems.  For better or worse, marriage is becoming less popular in western society.  People are marrying later in life, or not at all.  Children are not being produced at the same rate as competing cultures. Now the real question in my mind is why should we encourage homosexuals to marry?  Times have changed, but not in a way that gives society any benefit from encouraging homosexuals to marry.  Modern Marriage in many ways is a subsidy.  Better tax rates for the married.  But why should we subsidize behavior that isn\'t going to yield the desired benefit (children)?  From the governments point of view they may as well be giving roommates a tax break, just for being roommates.  Now I know homosexuals can adopt, but if we\'re trying to incentivize adoption, it makes more sense to incentivize adoption directly, and not grant anyone that subsidy before they actually adopt.There is also the subject of bisexuality to consider.  We often forget, that while most of us think in terms of straight and gay, bisexuals actually outnumber homosexuals considerably.  Bisexuals represent a group that the government can essentially influence in their marriage preference.  If a person can choose between one lifestyle/relationship that will produce children, and one that will not, the government actually has an incentive to encourage bisexuals to marry the opposite sex and breed.  Most homosexuals really want the benefits of legal marriage, not just for economic, but for social acceptance reasons.  This is completely understandable, and while I empathize with their feelings, it doesn\'t make gay marriage make any more sense logically or socio-economically.Honestly the only logical reason I can think of to allow gay marriage isn\'t really logical at all.  Popular opinion.  If the majority of people want it, then by all means let them have it, even if it isn\'t arguably the best thing for society.  Still, people should be allowed to discuss the pros and cons in a rational respectful manner, without being called inhuman and accused of bigotry, simply for espousing a traditional opinion that the vast majority of the world\'s population still thinks is correct.  Also please understand that I bear homosexuals no ill will.  Being straight or gay has no bearing on whether or not you are a wonderful person, and I know many absolutely wonderful homosexuals.  Anyone who would attempt to hurt another person physically for their sexual preference is an inhuman fool.  ", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"It depends upon how you define the term \"marriage\".  I tend to think of it in it\'s \"traditional\" terms: a religious ceremony which two people have to go through in order to have permission to have sex.  Lets just for the moment ignore the whole wedding dowry/women are property thing and focus upon the idea that this ceremony involves two people asking to have to have the OK to have sex based on moral grounds, because sex outside of marriage is a sin, from a priest who was probably most likely abusing the choir boys sickens me.Whilst I recognise that gays are looking for public/legal recognition of their relationship but I still think it comes back to that traditional definition of marriage and I feel (perhaps irrationally, I admit!) that homosexuals getting married somehow reinforces this \"begging the church for permission\" idea.  The marriage rights that gays are fighting for stem from those religious institutions which seek to encourage people to \"fall in line\" by offering marriage benefits (tax benefits, etc) and so I\'ll always feel that marriage between anyone reinforces a religious institution\'s power over people.  Even people who don\'t believe in god absolutely must get married in a church (= money for the church).In short, I feel that marriage is the primary way that churches/synagoges/mosques have power over people and it\'s a hold that won\'t ever go away until people (all people) reject the concept of marriage.", bewertung:"0"}

{text:"In case anyone wanted to know...For persons over age 21, this measure would remove state law criminal and civil prohibitions with respect to growing, manufacturing, distributing, and possessing marijuana consistent with a state marijuana licensing and regulatory system. Without violating state law, people over age 21 could grow, distribute, or possess marijuana, as authorized under various types of licenses. People could only buy limited amounts of marijuana at a time, and possession of marijuana by people over age 21 in amounts that do not exceed that limit would not violate state law. It would still be a crime to grow, distribute, or possess marijuana except by following the licensing and other requirements of this measure. A license to produce marijuana would make it legal under state law to grow marijuana. A license to process marijuana would make it legal under state law to process and package marijuana. It would also make it legal under state law to make products that contain marijuana. Licensed producers and processors could sell marijuana at wholesale, but could not sell marijuana at retail directly to consumers. Licensed retailers could sell marijuana, and products containing marijuana, to consumers at retail. Licensed retailers could also sell paraphernalia items used to store or use marijuana. It would cost $250 to apply for a license. It would also cost $1,000 every year to get and keep a license. A separate license would be required for each location. Locations could not be within 1,000 feet of any school, playground, recreation centers, child care center, park, transit center, library, or game arcade. Producers and processors could not have any financial interest in any licensed marijuana retailer. It would still be a state law crime for a person under age 21 to grow, sell, or possess marijuana. It also would remain illegal under state law for anybody, including people who have licenses under this measure, to sell marijuana or products containing marijuana to people under 21 years old. Licensed marijuana retailers could not sell any products other than marijuana and items used to store or use marijuana. Licensed marijuana retailers could not allow people under age 21 on their premises. Signs posted by licensed marijuana retailers that are visible to the public would be limited in size and content. No marijuana could be displayed in a way that is visible from a public place. It would be illegal to open or consume any marijuana product on the premises. Licensed marijuana retailers could be fined for violations. This measure would prohibit any person from opening a package containing marijuana in public view. This measure would limit advertising of marijuana. Advertisements would need to be at least 1,000 feet away from any school, playground, recreation center, child care center, park, transit center, library, or game arcade. Advertisements would be banned from buses and light rail, and from government property. The state could deny, suspend, or cancel licenses. Local governments could submit objections for the state to consider in determining whether to grant or renew a license. The state could inspect the premises of any license holder. Prior criminal conduct could be considered for purposes of granting, renewing, denying, suspending or revoking a license. The state could not issue a license to anybody under age 21. The state could adopt further rules to implement this measure. This measure would require licensed producers and processors to submit marijuana samples to an independent lab for regular testing. The state would receive test results. Marijuana that does not satisfy state standards would be destroyed. Sales of marijuana would be taxed. Marijuana excise taxes, in the amount of 25% of the selling price, would be collected on all sales of marijuana, at each level of production and distribution. Sale by a marijuana producer to a marijuana processor would be subject to a 25% tax. A sale by the processor to a retailer would be subject to an additional 25% tax. Sales of marijuana by a retailer would be subject to an additional 25% tax. State and local sales taxes would also apply to retail sales of marijuana. The measure directs the state to spend designated amounts from the marijuana excise taxes, license fees, penalties, and forfeitures for certain purposes. Those purposes include spending fixed dollar amounts on: administration of this measure; a survey of youth regarding substance use and other information; a cost-benefit evaluation of the implementation of this measure; and web-based public education materials about health and safety risks posed by marijuana use. Remaining money would be distributed as follows: 50% for the state basic health plan; 15% for programs and practices aimed at prevention or reduction of substance abuse; 10% for marijuana education; 5% for other health services; 1% for research on short-term and long-terms effects of marijuana use; and .75% for a program that seeks to prevent school dropouts. The remaining 18.25% would be distributed to the state general fund. This measure would also amend the law that prohibits driving under the influence. It would specifically prohibit driving under the influence of marijuana. Consent to testing to determine whether a driver’s blood contains alcohol or any drug would specifically apply to marijuana as well. State law that currently specifies a level of blood alcohol concentration for driving under the influence would be amended to also specify a level of the active ingredient in marijuana. A person who drives with a higher blood concentration of that active ingredient, or who is otherwise under the influence of marijuana, would be guilty of driving under the influence. For persons under 21, any level of the active ingredient of marijuana would be prohibited. Federal marijuana laws could still be enforced in Washington.**TL;DR** Treated kind of like alcohol. **EDIT:** Thought this article was important: [Justice department: Drug laws remain unchanged](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57546495/justice-department-drug-laws-remain-unchanged-following-passage-of-marijuana-ballot-initiatives/)", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"If the video doesn\'t load, here are the integral quotes:&gt;\"I have to tell you that over the course of several years as I have talked to friends and family and neighbors when I think about members of my own staff who are in incredibly committed monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together, when I think about those soldiers or airmen or marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained, even now that Don’t Ask Don’t Tell is gone, because they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage, at a certain point I’ve just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same sex couples should be able to get married.\"and&gt;“It’s interesting, some of this is also generational. You know when I go to college campuses, sometimes I talk to college Republicans who think that I have terrible policies on the economy, on foreign policy, but are very clear that when it comes to same sex equality or, you know,  believe in equality. They are much more comfortable with it. You know, Malia and Sasha, they have friends whose parents are same-sex couples. There have been times where Michelle and I have been sitting around the dinner table and we’re talking about their friends and their parents and Malia and Sasha, it wouldn’t dawn on them that somehow their friends’ parents would be treated differently. It doesn’t make sense to them and frankly, that’s the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective.”", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"I\'m sure that smarter people than me will discuss this with better data, but this may turn out to be a pretty savvy move politically. - The number of winnable voters, who might have voted for Obama but for this pronouncement, must be de minimis. It seems likely that the large majority of people powerfully motivated by opposition to gay marriage are completely lost to Obama.- Liberal Democratic voters just got something to get excited about, and to donate, campaign, and block-walk for.- Gay voters (and donors, and their families) are seeing the beginning of the end for the biggest obstacle to full legal equality. Tremendously motivating.- Obama took a huge step to permanently binding the younger generation of voters to identify with the Democratic party. Support for gay marriage is overwhelming among younger voters. - Can you imagine how charming the coming shitstorm from the right is gonna be? Do you think it\'s going to win a lot of moderates into the GOP fold?- Gay marriage is unpopular with black voters, but Obama is uniquely positioned to get 90%+ of black votes regardless. What are they going to do, vote Romney? And isn\'t it likely that the President\'s stance could lead to a softening of opposition in the black community?- Similarly, Latino voters tend to oppose gay marriage, but they have been kicked in the teeth by Republicans so hard in recent years. Maybe gay marriage is less of an obstacle than zealous anti-immigration laws, \"show your papers\" laws, and the general contempt for Latinos prevalent in much of the activist right. I hope so.I might be being Pollyanaish, but if Obama wins, this will probably be seen as a brilliant risk. If he loses, it might scare Democrats off of supporting gay marriage for another generation.So let\'s make sure he wins, OK?EDIT: For example: http://www.dccc.org/marriage-equality", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"For those on the right calling out Obama on his “evolution” and intimating that he has been, in fact, for gay marriage the whole time, you are absolutely right. Good eye, Cletus. Most fair-minded people are.And for those on the left who have been cursing him for not immediately taking action to impose a liberal-friendly agenda, chill the hell out and give him a little space. Rome wasn’t built in a day and ignorance can’t be outlawed overnight.His decision not to announce his pro-gay marriage view until now was totally political. And unfortunately, totally necessary. Change, regrettably, has to happen slowly in America. Perceptions have to evolve. We have to baby step. People don’t respond well to drastic change, no matter how common sense it might seem. When Clinton enacted DADT, you can believe that he knew it was ridiculous. Think how silly and insulting that policy was in retrospect. You can serve in the armed forces, you can put your life on the line for our country, and okay, you can be gay. But just don’t let us know about it because it’s icky.But at the time, America wasn’t ready for an outright ban of sexual discrimination in the military. And Clinton, seeing the longview, realized that the best that he could do at that point was to get the ball rolling in some way. To ease people into change. And finally last year, when people were ready, they got rid of DADT entirely. This is how change is responsibly effected.And what has happened? Has our military crumbled? Have we heard many reports of soldiers rabidly banging each other against one another’s will? Of course not.Far lefties and far righties will condemn The President for not being true to his convictions; For hiding his true colors for political purposes. And they’re correct. He did. But he has little choice. Being an extremist candidate in a specific, extremist area and running for congress is one thing. A candidate representing the Los Angeles area could spark up a joint and then blow a dude during a televised debate and they’d still elect him.  And a candidate in Arkansas could burn a cross on a black guy’s lawn on MLK Day and they would still elect him and then have someone airbrush a representation of that event and put it on their state license plate.But when you’re running for President, it’s a different deal. How does being completely candid with your opinions and totally up front about your convictions work out at a Presidential campaign level? Ask Ron Paul or Dennis Kucinich. Admire both of them for their candor, whether you believe in their ideals or not, but then look at their numbers. America, as a whole, isn’t having it.Now, I will not be so gracious as to let this also totally apply to Mitt Romney. He’s a moderate despite his efforts to change.  Everyone knows it. That’s his grave misfortune considering the present state of his party.   But this guy has not just “evolved”.  He has blatantly changed positions on virtually every major issue. There’s a big difference between being pragmatic and just being habitually schiesty and pathetically malleable.  Romney’s positions change throughout the day depending on where he’s speaking. Even staunch Republicans recognize that, and though they are less likely to say it out loud now they were screaming it from the rooftops before he was their unavoidable candidate and they realized they were stuck with him.I do not agree with everything Obama has done and said. Not by a long stretch. But I have always been able to see his game plan. And he continues to impress me with the methodical way that he attempts to accomplish his agenda.To me, today’s announcement was as inevitable as it was refreshing.", bewertung:"1"}

Now, the president might not receive the outpouring of support that he did from religious and \"Blue Dog\" Democrats in the 2008 campaign.
