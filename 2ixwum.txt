{text:"Having sexual relations with someone of the same sex is a sin.  (Let\'s please not try to debate that premise at the moment.)  And, sin is bad, and Christians should discourage it.  A lot of people just make the jump here to say this type of sin should be discouraged *by the government* - which is a huge logical leap, unless they also want to outlaw every non-Christian religion.  (Which they don\'t, at least every one of them I\'ve talked to.)A better attempt to bridge the gap that I\'ve heard is that, if the government starts approving same-sex marriage, it will make it much more culturally acceptable, which will mean a lot more people sinning in that way.  One example I\'ve frequently heard is that kids will learn about it in schools and start seeing it as acceptable when it is, in fact, sinful.  An even better example is the anti-discrimination laws which have been used to rope Christian florists and bakers into participating in same-sex couples\' weddings.  Many people want to cut all this off at the root by banning same-sex marriage.Technically speaking, these examples have it wrong.  Schools are normalizing homosexual behavior even now, and anti-discrimination laws are dragging people in to help with \"commitment ceremonies\" even now, without the need for legally-recognized marriage.  But, will changing the definition of marriage help increase that?  Maybe.  My ideal solution is that the government should stop trying to define marriage at all.  But I know it\'s politically impossible to get there from here, and I\'m not sure of the second-best solution.", bewertung:"-1"}

{text:"Homoesexuality is a sin. Like any sin, a society should not promote the acceptance of the sin.     Homoesexuality is a perversion of the God ordained relationship of a man and a woman.Homosexuality may be good for gay people, but society as a whole, will suffer.    Homosexuality is just one more step backwards in the ongoing war between individual freedoms versus the good of society as a whole.    More individual \"rights\" will follow until we live in  morally bankrupt society where anything goes so long as it doesn\'t hurt anyone else.    Our society is so conflicted. People are becoming responsible only for what feels good but being resolved of individual responsibility to feed, clothe, house and generally care for themselves, yet individual rights are the reason for abortion, gay marriage, etc.    Society must pay for people\'s abortions, health care, food, drink, phones, unemployment, etc while these same people can engage in immoral and illegal activity.    As a great Nation, we are on the way out!  Thank you progressives!    Cue up the slave mongers!", bewertung:"-1"}
