{text:"- Gays can be parents,  whether they get their children through sex (not with each other, of course) or by adoption.  The point isn\'t to promote more babies.  We have enough already.  The point is to provide a caring, stable home environment for children so they become productive citizens someday.  So if we are trying to encourage a loving stable, multi-parent home for children, there\'s no reason to deny gays the same rights.- Procreation is not the only reason we encourage marriage.  It is healthier to have people in loving bonds with each other.  Married people, in theory, take care of each other and support each other.  Marriage is a form of social safety net that helps take some of the pressure off the government.  It\'s no less a health and safety issue for gays than for straights.- The argument that people were going to form a lasting pair bond anyway isn\'t more true for gays than for straights.  We want to encourage people to join for life, in sickness and in health, in times of joy and times of trouble.  If we give only one special group the tax incentives, ability to visit in the hospital, pension benefits, etc. then we are flat out discriminating.  If we think that these benefits will encourage people to form stable, long term, supportive relationships after the initial bloom of sex together is over, we should encourage that for all, not just for some.", bewertung:"1"}

{text:"&gt; It encourages stability by increasing the \"cost\" of leaving your partner.I\'d think emotions would overrule the financial side quite easily.&gt; However, the government has far less reason to provide the same incentive to a family they know will not produce new, productive, taxpaying citizens.Going by this line of reasoning: Adult working age immigrants are way more cost effective and have immediate pay off, compared to breeding new workers from scratch.There\'s also no shortage of people. The population is growing exponentially.", bewertung:"1"}
{text:"The thing about this argument is that the people who argue it really don\'t believe it, and just use it as a cover for discriminating against homosexuals.How can I tell?  If they really believed this, not only would people be trying to stop gay marriage, they would also be trying to stop marriage for elderly people who can\'t reproduce, the childless, the sterile, etc.  But they never actually do this.  Somehow it\'s always about gay people.  This argument is just misdirection.", bewertung:"0"}

{text:"Not all of the tax breaks involve incentives for childbearing. In fact, I even doubt those exist. Marriage isn\'t about children, it\'s about dependence on each other, and added cost. A family doesn\'t mean \"with kids\". There are multiple definitions. Not only that, but if we really care that much then how about we lobby to rewrite the tax breaks for childless couples? Preventing a group from marrying is never logical. ", bewertung:"1"}
